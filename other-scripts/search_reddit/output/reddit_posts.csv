App for immersive reading and bilingual books.,"Hi language learners,

I’m excited to share with you an iOS app I’ve built for reading books with parallel translations and audiobooks for immersive reading.  

I personally don’t like AI-generated voices for immersive reading, so I used real audiobooks synced with texts. I also believe that although machine translations have improved significantly, human translators are still the best. This inspired me to develop this app so that users can read and listen to books with real audiobooks and translations. I believe intermediate and advanced language learners will benefit from this app.

Usage is very simple, there are different reading modes (Translation, Sync, and Audio) that you can easily switch between by holding or tapping the mode button.

* Translation Mode: Tap on sentences to see the corresponding parallel sentences.
* Sync Mode: Tap on sentences to play/pause immersive reading.
* Audio Mode: Engage in immersive reading with media player controls.

Currently, the app supports English, German, and French, with plans to add more languages and books based on user feedback.

I would love for you to try it out and share your thoughts or any recommendations.

Basically all of the articles, blogs, or videos I have consumed on the topic are set up in a biased way. This goes for both the output-pro and the input-pro articles. However, I want to be clear that I’m only talking about the articles I have consumed. I’ve barely scratched the surface, let’s be real. Mostly I’ve only found anecdotes, the most recent and enlightening of which is “From the Outside In” by J. Marvin Brown. \n\nThe only article I found even remotely related to this is one written by Benny Lewis of Fluent in 3 Months. I don’t know if this is what you were talking about. Obviously I didn’t search for very long, but so far I haven’t found anything else. \n\nAccording to that article, he took the term “passive” to its extreme by having content on in the background and then actively doing something else. This was compared to his extreme of “active” with speaking and writing where, sorry for my assuming, he devoted a lot more focused energy. Of course this will produce different results. Anything you do while multitasking will not be as good of quality if compared to you doing that same activity but with undivided attention. \n\nI have nothing against the guy. The same thing goes for studies or blogs I read where people do the opposite. They will say only input is effective and compare it to something like flash cards, but the most inefficient flash cards imaginable (e.g. single-word and obviously out of context or just saying “do flash cards however you want!” when most of the students probably have no idea how to use flash cards when learning a language). That’s also ridiculous. \n\nAnyway, the way to actually settle this would be to set up an experiment where you ask for the participants’ preference or opinion on effective study (focus on output vs focus on input). You then (not completely) randomly assign these participants to two different styles of classes while controlling for percentage of people who agree with the type of study. You would then need to have teachers who fully believe in the value of whatever the class is, explain the benefits of the approach clearly and concisely, and finally actually teach the class while pretty strictly adhering to the approach. You would also need to control for what they’re doing outside of class by either asking them to do nothing, have the exact same amount of homework, or, if they do do something, have them report what they did and for how long. You could then reasonably compare the results of the two groups and see which group, on average, performed better. \n\nAs far as I know, such an intense experiment has not been done…because as you can see it’s super intense. All I know of is anecdotes of different styles of teaching at different schools. One that I recently read and was quite enlightening for me was “From the Outside In” by J. Marvin Brown.

reading German literature- how much could this aid my language development?,"I am probably a B1 level in German and I am an (english) literature student. I find the learner texts meant for B1-A2 or even B2 boring and I want to begin reading people like Kafka and Goethe. My plan is to start with Kafka and go through each short story very slowly, analyzing the grammatical structures and making flashcards of vocabulary I don't know. then i would practice these grammatical structures and study the flashcards. 

do you think this will help me? I assume so, but more specifically how? Will this only improve my reading ability, or will my unconscious knowledge of German grammar structures be improved, etc?  My current areas i need to improve are my writing and speaking skills, as well as my vocabulary. would I be better off spending my time doing intense vocabulary flashcard review and intense grammar practice, or this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/16h9mox/reading_german_literature_how_much_could_this_aid/,8,10,"[""First of all, yes, reading is not just beneficial, it's essential if you want to reach advanced levels of proficiency in your TL. Your vocabulary range and writing skills are usually in direct relation to the amount of books you have read. About 10 000 pages (or 3 000 000 words) of books is a more or less agreed upon number you need to read to start feeling comfortable with reading. To improve speaking skills you would need to listen and, not surprisingly, speak.\n\nSecond, I would not recommend Kafka for your first book if you've only read graded readers so far. There's a world of difference between him and graded readers. A lot of books are significantly easier than the first, but still more difficult than the latter. I would suggest that you start with a book where you can read 20-50 pages a day without a problem. Possible candidates: children's books (Michael Ende, James Krüss, Angela Sommer-Bodenburg), YA (Cornelia Funke, Kerstin Gier), crime (Friedrich Ani), horror (Wolfgang Hohlbein), fantasy (Markus Heitz), etc.\n\nI love Kafka myself, don't get me wrong. It's just not where you start your German reading journey, it's something you gradually build up to.\n\nBTW, if you're going to read books like this:\n\n>go through each short story very slowly, analyzing the grammatical structures and making flashcards of vocabulary I don't know. then i would practice these grammatical structures and study the flashcards.\n\n(which is called intensive reading), make sure to read enough books extensively as well, otherwise reading 10 000 pages would take you forever."", '>My plan is to start with Kafka and go through each short story very slowly\n\nOthers have made this point--and it\'s kind of obvious when you think about it, but also not, which is why I repeat: Two crucial parts of language learning are variety and volume.\n\nIn other words, the person who takes six months to get through one Kafka novella is worse off than the person who reads six graded readers by different authors in the same time period.\n\nAlso, you should have a multi-pronged approach: Language learning is rarely either/or. So yes, read AND do vocab review AND practice grammar AND etc.\n\nFinally, don\'t expect one book to work miracles. Unless you reread the text multiple times--enough to start memorizing lines outright--your ""take"" from an individual book will be small. It\'s like someone who goes to the gym and spends 30 minutes doing one perfect squat. You\'d think: *You know you have to do two, maybe three sets of eight to get anywhere, right? And over months. Stop treating one rep as if it\'s this special thing.*', ""Extensive reading is excellent for increasing vocabulary and intuitive grasp of grammar. You absorb new information by seeing it in the context of language that you do understand - repeatedly. This means that learning from text that doesn't have tons of unknown words or overly puzzling sentences is the most effective and relatively pain free way to learn from reading (and the same is true for learning by listening). I would prioritize reading time over vocabulary and grammar studies with the caveat that you should pick material that's not crazy hard and work your way up to advanced material via just reading a lot. I don't study German so I have no idea whether Kafka is considered difficult for a learner. But you may find young adult books, or even chapter books for preteens, more tolerable than learner texts. The issue with learner texts, besides the lack of interest, is that it's hard to get the sheer volume of material you need to build reading fluency just from graded readers and things. For that you kind of have to rely on books aimed at native speakers just because there is so much more of it at any given level."", 'So, you have never read a real book in German before and you want to start with very old texts and, in case of Goethe, poetry?\n\nDo yourself a favour and start with some modern book, mystery or even young adult as they tend to be less complicated.', ""At B1, I would still recommend graded readers or YA literature. Kafka is probably a bit too difficult at this level. As for Goethe, since he lived two centuries ago, his vocabulary is somewhat different from that of modern German. I'd start with something more contemporary. \n\nI don't see why you have to choose between reading only and other activities only, Spend some time on (intensive) reading and some time on grammar practice."", 'I’ve never read Kafka but Goethe probably won’t help you much, it’s difficult because a lot of the vocab in it is outdated. You could find some YA novels you like or maybe satirical essays by Wladimir Kaminer if that’s your thing. Trümmerliteratur might be good because it’s more often than not simply structured and there are plenty of academic essays about it as well. If you haven’t checked it out already, the Goethe Institute’s online library is great.', ""Reading advanced texts is perfectly fine as long as you temper your expectations and you practise extensive reading instead of intensive reading (the latter would be too burdensome at this point)\n\nI've very casually taught myself Italian and I might be at B1-B2 (not sure, don't really care). On a whim, I read an advanced text recently - a piece of very academic queer theory (Mario Mieli, if anyone's curious).\n\nThere's words I don't know on *every single page*, and occasionally I can't follow a sentence if I don't use a dictionary, but I'm revising lots of grammar and vocab and having fun with the topic\\*. I'm not too worried about learning all the new words I encoutner unless I think they're basic-ish. And when I read it aloud to myself, it helps me practise stuff like tricky consonant clusters (and uh... speaking practice in general is good).\n\n\\*After a few languages, one starts to get bored of the usual textbook topics used in A1-B2... oh let's go supermarket shopping again, oh let's go to the beach again... I digress but choosing fun topics/texts is important, because your motivation/willpower isn't strained"", 'I think it will be great.  I personally would skip the flash cards part (at first), because you won\'t have any way to tell what vocabulary will be important, at least until you understand enough to know what words are (a) essential in a wide variety of circumstances and (b) constant sources of irritation for you.\n\nThe natural repetition that comes with reading a lot will take care of a great deal of your need for vocabulary for a long time.  I\'d be a lot more positive about flash cards if people were proficient at memorizing lists of 50,000+ words that way.\n\nRegarding grammar:  My personal sense is that what you stand to gain (particularly as you acquire the vocabulary) is an intuitive sense for common phrases, sentence structures, etc.  You\'ll find that expressions spring fully formed into your mind and not really know where they came from, but somehow they\'ll be right.  This is a lot like what it\'s like speaking or writing in my native language, but it\'s more sporadic and less reliable in my L2.\n\nAfter doing this a bunch, grammar study will make a lot more sense because you\'ll already have the experience to put what you\'ve seen many times into a framework of rules.\n\nEdit:  My hellish source of irritation is ""þannig,"" which means ""thus,"" or ""like so.""  I\'ve looked it up hundreds of times and have it in my (small) Anki deck, and still can never remember when I read it.  That\'s life.\n\nEdit 2:  My personal experience doing this kind of intensive reading is that I was appreciably reading with much greater ease 1/3 of the way into my first book than I had been on the first page.  It\'s startling how fast you can improve just by seeing words in a meaningful context.', ""Kafka isn't a good read at B1 level, and Goethe even less. They use outdated language and style. I recommend modern authors instead.\n\nActually, at B1 level you will profit most from books intended for young audiences, 14-18 years old. [They are commonly called *Jugendbücher* in German.](https://www.jugendbuch-couch.de/)"", 'In my opinion, you’re in luck.  Reading Kafka’s “The Trial” or “In the Penal Colony” might still be way  too difficult; *however*, large swaths of “The Metamorphosis” (Die Verwandlung) are actually quite accessible to an intermediate learner.  Kafka’s reputation for writing in a journalistic style notwithstanding, much of “The Metamorphosis”  rather has the tenor of a fairy tale.   Hermann Hesse’s “Demian” is likewise accessible to intermediate learners— and it is available in a dual-language edition.  Then there are the Märchen of the Brothers Grimm…. Lots of good material for an intermediate learner, in my opinion.   But Kafka’s “Metamorphosis” is what really surprised me, for its relative simplicity of form (even if not simplicity of content).  For example:\n\nGregors Blick richtete sich dann zum Fenster, und das trübe Wetter – man hörte Regentropfen auf das Fensterblech aufschlagen – machte ihn ganz melancholisch. »Wie wäre es, wenn ich noch ein wenig weiterschliefe und alle Narrheiten vergäße,« dachte er….']"
I just read 4 books in German and progressed a lot! I want to share my experience.,"Reading books in foreign languages is my favorite way to build vocabulary. There are many ways to improve language skills, but practice in any form is essential—this can be reading texts, watching movies, listening to podcasts/audiobooks/anything, having conversations, and so on. For me, tracking progress is easiest when reading, and I want to share my experience.

Recently, I finished reading a series of four books in German ([https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074CHF991](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074CHF991)) - this is a translation of the Russian series ""Страж"" by Alexey Pehov. By the way, he is one of my favorite modern Russian fantasy authors. I read this series a long time ago (the last book was published about 10 years ago, I think), but a few months ago, I stumbled upon the German translation and decided to re-read it - this time not just for fun, but also for language practice. Pehov writes excellent books, rich in descriptions, which makes it quite challenging when reading them in translation.

It took me over a month to read the first book, and I marked about 1.5k words as unknown on my Kindle (looking up their translations). The first third of the book was very difficult, but it gradually became easier and easier. I read the second book a bit faster, but it still took about a month, with around 1.1k new words. It got better with the third book—about three weeks (\~900 words), and only about ten days for the fourth (\~500 words). Of course, external factors affected my reading speed, but the progress is evident.

In general, it helped me not only with vocabulary, but also with formulating my thoughts.

I then transferred all these words to Anki.

Next, I plan to read something originally written in German (in addition to other practice methods).

P.S. The covers of the German editions are simply gorgeous

"I spent the last 3 years creating my own language learning game / app while bedridden with a chronic illness. I finally revealed this week. It’s inspired by Studio Ghibli and Pokemon. (We’re currently looking for Spanish, German, French learners for alpha test)",,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgO37j5aSFw,1254,107,"['So because it might be the first thing a lot are curious about. [Fluyo](https://www.fluyoapp.com) is planned to be free (either free trial or free by default with potential to upgrade to premium - similar to duo). We are also currently looking for alpha testers (for German, Spanish and French) to help call out bugs & errors that aren’t caught by our engineers/language experts. You can sign up at bottom of website for alpha testing [www.fluyoapp.com](https://www.fluyoapp.com)\n\n**More about the app (long)**\n\nFluyo was originally created out of a need to make Anki better. I personally loved Anki but the outdated UI, avalanche of cards to return to after eventually getting demotivated from using it and the poor UX (without adding a bunch of addons) left much to be desired. So initially we set out to make a much better version of Anki. Anki 2022 if you will. The goal was to make it appealing to your everyday person from a looks and UX standpoint, to have it be as effective as Anki (we use the same supermemo2 algorithm), and to incorporate some much needed features natively on mobile.\n\nI.e. When you add a new word it instantly populates with example sentences to choose from, and can even color the background of the card depending on word gender or type. Other features we’ve built are an ability to easily share your deck with others and to review your deck in various modes (quiz, fill in the blank and even a listening mode).We also included Anki-importing and a daily reward feature so every time you hit your daily review goal (10-200 cards a day) you are rewarded accordingly with in-game currency, achievements and even items. There are a handful of other features regarding our flashcards as well that aren’t public yet.\n\nBut somewhere along the way of creating flashcards we realized it would be nice to have a way to learn vocabulary outside the bounds of SRS. So I invested almost every dollar I made since starting YouTube into hiring a team of 17 to build something we call Journey mode. It’s arguably the best part of Fluyo. It’s essentially the story mode of our game and covers the most common 4,000 words in a language. I won’t go into too many details but think vocab booster (w/ context) meets pokemon meets world of warcraft meets a studio ghibli aesthetic. It’s really something we are proud of. It also plugs into our flashcard system, so every word you learn on your Journey goes directly into your deck(s).\n\nJourney and Flashcards aside, we also developed some kickass mini games that are extremely fun that you can use to practice and learn new vocabulary while competing with friends / people on the internet. The games also link to your flashcard decks so you can review your words via games for the times you get bored of flashcards.\n\nWe also have an array of social features from messaging to group chats, that are chock full of language learning specific features (i.e. tapping on a word in a message and being able to translate it & add to your deck). We match people/groups based on their interests and also use some cool default profile photos similar to Xbox live, so as to avoid the creepiness that occurs on platforms like Tandem/Hellotalk.\n\nI know some are hesitant regarding gamification of language learning. However, I believe gamification done right can really help out millions of people. I remember back to my time playing MMOs for 10+ hours a day and always thought that if language learning could be as addicting as a good video game then people could effortlessly spend hours a day doing it. Most on this subreddit CAN spend hours a day learning although even for us I certainly wouldn’t call doing so effortless as eventually motivation does wane. However the vast majority of people CAN’T, I hope this app can be a way for the average person to do so too.\n\nI’m going to stop writing now as I’m getting a headache (curse this illness some days it’s really hard ;/). Will be around to answer questions for as long as my head lets me!\n\nAlso if you are interested in alpha testing a certain language, [there’s a form on the bottom of our site](https://www.fluyoapp.com)', 'Am a high school student learning french, would love to test it out!', ""I'm very excited for this.

"Does anyone here want to start learning Spanish, German, or Japanese? We're making a manga in these languages that's really easy to read, and we're releasing books 1&2 for free until Aug 10th.","Hey everyone, we're the Crystal Hunters team, and we're making a manga in really easy Spanish, German, and Japanese with a pro manga artist.

You only need to learn 89 Spanish words, 82 German words, or 87 Japanese words to read the first 100 page book of monsters and magic, and we add 15-20 more words and a few new grammar points to each 100 page book after that to gradually level you up! We also made free guides which help you read and understand the whole manga from zero in each language. The guides and the first books will always be free to read, and the second book is free until August 10th (but will continue to be free if you have Kindle Unlimited).

App in development: Comprehensible input reading in any language,"Hi all. I've been learning languages and tinkering with ways of getting more quantity for 20 years. A lot of my learning is with using parallel texts (currently I'm reading Greek novels - a book in Greek, and the translation in Norwegian, side by side). I've also tinkered with a lot of tools, here's an early mouse-over Indonesian dictionary 17 years ago! :) [http://reganmian.net/blog/2006/05/03/indonesian-dictionarymouseover-terbang-dengan-bahasa-indonesia/](http://reganmian.net/blog/2006/05/03/indonesian-dictionarymouseover-terbang-dengan-bahasa-indonesia/)  


But of course, AI is a game changer. LLMs are not only good at translation, but can also generate example sentences, can explain concepts, can summarize, simplify texts, etc.  


I had this idea for a while: Instead of reading Twitter or Tiktok when I have five minutes on my phone, I'd like to work on a text in my target language that is interesting to me, but not too difficult. I thought about using GPT to process a text - first split it into paragraphs, and for each paragraph, generate a translation, a simplified version, explanations of difficult concepts, etc, and then write a mobile/desktop app where I could add new texts, and read texts on the go - where it showed one paragraph at a time, let me switch between the different modalities, kept track of where I was, etc.  


I've made the very first stab and have something incredibly rudimentary, but which actually works. And I have lot's of ideas - definitively can improve a lot on the prompts, better UX, maybe add text-to-speech through an API, SRS etc. It would be cool to eventually turn it into a proper multiuser app that anyone can use - where you could even define your own prompts, your own combinations of views (first play the audio then show the text, or show me English translation underneath each sentence, etc).

How I Started Reading German Literature After 76 Hours of Study,"After seeing a lot of posts and material about learning language X in Y number of months or Z number of years, I started tracking my language learning sessions for German. 

After all, someone who studies 5 hours a day versus someone who studies 1 hour a day will make different progress within Y number of months or Z number of years for a language.

This post is about how I started reading German literature for native speakers after 76 hours of study.

Just a warning: Am I fluent in German? No. Do I understand everything? No. Am I reading actual German literature with the help of a dictionary now? Yes.

To be fair, I was not starting from absolute 0 with German when I began this. I had taken about 6 one hour tutoring sessions in high school for German before I stopped so I knew that German had 3 genders and I knew the accusative case was ""den"" for the masculine definite article but that's about as far as I got.

For my German study, I went through the Assimil German With Ease course from 1987, the German Without Toil course from the 1950s and then finally the newer Assimil German With Ease course from the 2000s.

I also did flashcards on Anki from the ""German Sentences 2/3"" deck which is apparently a collection of sentences from Tatoeba. From the Anki records, I went through 11,899 cards out of the total 62,840 cards.

Since I knew my goal was to read in German, I did zero listening practice and zero speaking practice. Even though the Assimil courses have audio, I barely listened to them and instead devoted the time to reading the lessons.

This worked out for me because I am able to learn much faster through visual comprehension than auditory comprehension. However, it also means that I am not practiced in listening to German or speaking it.

After studying the three Assimil courses and the flashcards for 76 hours, I was going to do the Linguaphone German course but as I started to read the first lessons and go through the basics I had gone over 3 times already, I realized I couldn't take it anymore and decided to jump into literature.

Since I am not a big fan of Harry Potter, I decided to start by reading ""Märchenmond"" by Wolfgang and Heike Hohlbein since it's a fantasy story and was also the work that launched Wolfgang Holhbein into becoming the top German fantasy writer.

As far as understanding the grammar went, I could understand all parts. There was no grammar that came up that I did not understand. 

The vocabulary was a different story, however. I had to look up every other word.

I used VocabTracker ([vocabtracker.com](https://vocabtracker.com)) which is an excellent tool. I imported each chapter into it and then used the pop up dictionary to look up the words by clicking on each word. This also stored the word and sentence it appeared in so that I could later export a csv file to import into Anki with cloze deletion flashcards that I have begun studying to increase my vocabulary.

When I got to the end of Märchenmond, I could read a lot faster and understood a lot more without using the dictionary through the practice of having read so much. I was still looking up words, however.

The next book I decided to tackle was ""Die unendliche Geschichte"" by Michael Ende. I chose this book because it was also fantasy and was even adapted into a popular movie in 1984 (The NeverEnding Story).

However, as I was halfway through, Professor Arguelles (whose Academy I attend) in the language learning support group suggested I join the German literature class. I am too busy to do this at the moment but he said they were reading ""Homo faber"" by Max Frisch. So I have started reading this book now.

Since I want to join the German literature class eventually, I realized that I needed to improve my listening comprehension and speaking skills. I started listening to Easy German Podcast while I drive and after about 16 hours of listening to them, I can more or less understand them, although there is still a lot of vocabulary I don't know.

As for speaking practice, I have started summarizing what I read in ""Homo faber"" after I read it and then writing what I speak into a Google doc so I can later get the grammar corrected by a native speaker.

I still have a long way to go in German but I am pleased with being able to read real German literature with the aid of a dictionary.

My plans from here are to continue practice summarizing my thoughts on Homo faber until I am able to speak well. I will study the flashcards I make from the vocabulary I get through using VocabTracker. I will continue to listen to German podcasts in the car. 

Then when my time is free again, I will join the German literature class at the language academy with Professor Arguelles.

Although I started German relatively recently, I have been studying languages all my life. I have a somewhat high level in Spanish, French and Japanese and I actively study Chinese, Spanish, Korean, German and Arabic everyday at the moment. So I imagine this gave me an advantage in learning German, too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/10w7is6/how_i_started_reading_german_literature_after_76/,7,2,"[""Nice, it's interesting how much easier it gets once you have learned several languages already. Though I personally wouldn't read literature that early, it can be a good challenge, but it can also be a bit of a time-waster looking up all those obscure words. I'm curious, how many words do you have to look up in this Homo Faber paragraph:\n\n>Ich habe mich schon oft gefragt, was die Leute eigentlich meinen, wenn sie von Erlebnis reden. Ich bin Techniker und gewohnt, die Dinge zu sehen, wie sie sind. Ich sehe alles, wovon sie reden, sehr genau; ich bin ja nicht blind. Ich sehe den Mond über der Wüste von Tamaulipas - klarer als je, mag sein, aber eine errechenbare Masse, die um unseren Planeten kreist, eine Sache der Gravitation, interessant, aber wieso ein Erlebnis? Ich sehe die gezackten Felsen, schwarz vor dem Schein des Mondes; sie sehen aus, mag sein, wie die gezackten Rücken von urweltlichen Tieren, aber ich weiß: Es sind Felsen, Gestein, wahrscheinlich vulkanisch, das müßte man nachsehen und feststellen. Wozu soll ich mich fürchten? Es gibt keine urweltlichen Tiere mehr. Wozu sollte ich sie mir einbilden? Ich sehe auch keine versteinerten Engel, es tut mir leid; auch keine Dämonen, ich sehe, was ich sehe: die üblichen Formen der Erosion, dazu meinen langen Schatten auf dem Sand, aber keine Gespenster. Wozu weibisch werden? Ich sehe auch keine Sintflut, sondern Sand, vom Mond beschienen, vom Wind gewellt wie Wasser, was mich nicht überrascht; ich finde es nicht fantastisch, sondern erklärlich. Ich weiß nicht, wie verdammte Seelen aussehen; vielleicht wie schwarze Agaven in der nächtlichen Wüste. Was ich sehe, das sind Agaven, eine Pflanze, die ein einziges Mal blüht und dann abstirbt. Ferner weiß ich, daß ich nicht (wenn es im Augenblick auch so aussieht) der erste oder letzte Mensch auf der Erde bin; und ich kann mich von der bloßen Vorstellung, der letzte Mensch zu sein, nicht erschüttern lassen, denn es ist nicht so. Wozu hysterisch sein? Gebirge sind Gebirge, auch wenn sie in gewisser Beleuchtung, mag sein, wie irgend etwas anderes aussehen, es ist aber die Sierra Madre Oriental, und wir stehen nicht in einem Totenreich, sondern in der Wüste von Tamaulipas, Mexico, ungefähr sechzig Meilen von der nächsten Straße entfernt, was peinlich ist, aber wieso ein Erlebnis? Ein Flugzeug ist für mich ein Flugzeug, ich sehe keinen ausgestorbenen Vogel dabei, sondern eine Super-Constellation mit Motor-Defekt, nichts weiter, und da kann der Mond sie bescheinen, wie er will. Warum soll ich erleben, was gar nicht ist? Ich kann mich auch nicht entschließen, etwas wie die Ewigkeit zu hören; ich höre gar nichts, ausgenommen das Rieseln von Sand nach jedem Schritt. Ich schlottere, aber ich weiß: in sieben bis acht Stunden kommt wieder die Sonne. Ende der Welt, wieso? Ich kann mir keinen Unsinn einbilden, bloß um etwas zu erleben. Ich sehe den Sand-Horizont, weißlich in der grünen Nacht, schätzungsweise zwanzig Meilen von hier, und ich sehe nicht ein, wieso dort, Richtung Tampico, das Jenseits beginnen soll. Ich kenne Tampico. Ich weigere mich, Angst zu haben aus bloßer Fantasie, beziehungsweise fantastisch zu werden aus bloßer Angst, geradezu mystisch. »Kommen Sie!« sagte ich. Herbert stand und erlebte noch immer."", 'To look up a word only takes half a second to click on it in VocabTracker. If the word is too obscure in Anki and I don\'t want to learn it right away then I just suspend it.\n\nOkay, I just translated the text. I did not expect to do all of it but I found it rather enjoyable and a good test of my German so I went all the way through. \n\nI did read this section so I must have looked up the words once when I read through it but I haven\'t had a chance to study the words consciously yet.\n\nHere is the text with the German words I didn\'t know in parentheses. There were 7 unique unknown words.\n\nI have often asked myself what the people actually mean when they speak of experience. I am a technician and used to seeing things as they are. I see everything they talk about very clearly; I am not blind. I see the moon over the Tamaulipas desert. Clearer than ever, perhaps, but a calculable mass that orbits our planet, a thing of gravitation, interesting, but what of an experience? I see the jagged rocks, black for the moonshine; they look, perhaps, like the jagged backs of (urweltichen) animals, but I know: They are rocks, stone, probably volcanic, that one would have to look up and determine. Why should I be afraid? There are no more (urweltichen) animals. Why should I imagine them? I also see no (versteinerten) angels, I am sorry; also no demons, I see what I see: the usual forms of erosion, and my long shadow on the sand, but no ghosts. Why become (weibisch)? I also see no (Sintflut), but sand, on which the moon shines, on which wind (gewellt) like water, that doesn\'t surprise me; I don\'t find it fantastic, but explainable. I don\'t know how damned souls look like; maybe like black agaves in the night desert. What I see are the agaves, a plant, that blooms once and then dies. Further I know that I am not (even though it also looks like it at the moment) the first or the last person on Earth; and I cannot be shaken by the mere idea of being the last person, because it is not so. Why be hysterical? Mountains are mountains, even if in certain lighting, perhaps, they look like something else, but it is the Sierra Madre Oriental, and we are not in the kingdom of death, but in the Tamaulipas desert in Mexico, about sixty miles from the nearest road, which is a pity, but why an experience? An airplane is for me an airplane, I see no dead bird with it, rather a Super-Constellation with a motor defect, nothing more, and there the moon can shine as it wants. Why should I experience what is not at all? I also cannot decide to hear something like the eternity; I hear nothing at all, except the (Rieseln) on sand after each step. I shiver, but I know: in seven to eight hours the sun comes again. End of the world, how so? I can\'t imagine nonsense just to experience something. I see the sand horizon, whitish in the green night, (schätzungsweise) twenty miles from here, and I don\'t see why there, toward Tampico, the beyond should begin. I know Tampico. I refuse to be afraid out of mere fantasy, or to become fantastic out of mere fear, straight mystical. ""Come!"" I said. Herbert stood and experienced still.']"

10 Tips for Language Learners,"I love learning languages and I am currently on my 5th language, German. I speak English, French, Mandarin and Spanish and after German, I plan on learning Italian and Portuguese.

Here are 10 tips I have for language learners that I have found helpful in my own language learning journey:

**Speaking**

Tip #1: Find native speakers to chat with through apps like HELLOTALK and TANDEM. I've made many friends all over the world through these language exchange apps and have had a chance to meet quite a few of them in real life. You may need to do some filtering on these apps though, because like with any social media apps, you're going to come across creeps who aren't there for the intended purpose of the app. But with some patience, you'll be able to make those quality connections to help your language learning as well as to build long-lasting friendships. If you are a shy person or don't like to talk to strangers online, just remember that you're completely anonymous and if you don't want to continue talking with someone, you have every right to leave the conversation.

Tip #2: Look on [MEETUP.com](https://meetups.com/) for language exchange groups in your area. Many cities have a MUNDOLINGO group where you just show up, tape some flag stickers on your shirt in descending order of your language proficiencies and walk around and converse with people who have flags of the languages you want to practice. It's a very friendly environment and especially if you're new to a city, it's a great way to meet new people.

**Listening**

Tip #3: I love the COFFEE BREAK LANGUAGE podcasts and I'm currently listening through the German series. They offer French, Spanish, Mandarin, German, Italian, English and Swedish podcasts at the moment. It takes you from basic grammar to more intermediate level conversations and the lessons are fun and applicable. Other ways to improve your listening is simply to listen to podcasts in your target language. CASTBOX is a great app for free podcasts.

Tip #4: If you have NETFLIX, you can turn your binge-watching into a language learning experience with two Google Chrome Extensions. NFLXMULTISUBS is an extension that allows you to turn on subtitles of two languages at the same time and LANGUAGE LEARNING WITH NETFLIX gives you a fully translated dialogue on the side of the screen as well as auto-pause after every sentence to give you time to learn some new vocabulary/phrases before moving on. If you want to access Netflix shows/movies from a different country, you can install a VPN (I would recommend ExpressVPN) and change your location to another country to watch its shows/movies.

**Reading**

Tip #5: If you are at an intermediate/advanced level, try reading the news or novels in the target language. I like to re-read novels I've already read in English because I already know the plot and it makes it a lot easier to understand in a different language. The Harry Potter series is a great series to do this exercise.

Tip #6: If you are a beginner, you can try an app called BEELINGUA which has bilingual short stories. Your screen will be split into two, one language on top and another on the bottom, and when you don't understand a phrase, simply highlight it and it will highlight the same section in the other language. Reading children stories is generally a good idea to pick up new and commonly used vocabulary and phrases.

**Writing**

Tip #7: Write a daily journal in your target language (maybe 10 minutes a day) about what you did that day, what you learned and what's on your mind. I found this exercise very helpful because you are training your brain to think in the target language. You'll also find that there are many words you don't know or thoughts you can't express in the target language, so this gives you a chance to look up those words/phrases and learn them. When I was learning Spanish last year and traveling in Australia/New Zealand, I decided to write my travel journal in Spanish. Although it was extremely challenging, I learned a lot of new vocabulary and phrases just from translating words and sentences that I didn't know. Even though the grammar was nowhere near perfect, it at least gets you in the mindset of thinking in a different language and trying to express yourself through writing in that language.

**Vocabulary**

Tip #8: You may be asking, ""so what do I do with all this new vocabulary and phrases that I've accumulated through the previous 7 tips?"" I would recommend an app called ANKIDROID which allows you to create your own flashcards. It's very simple to use and you can put all your new vocabulary and phrases there and do some memory practices every day.

**Grammar**

Tip #9: There are many free grammar textbooks online that you can download and do exercises in. If you would like some grammar books in Spanish or German, feel free to send me a message and I can email them to you.

Tip #10: Lastly, I recommend BABBEL for learning basic grammar of a language. It's an excellent and simple website that takes you through the beginner to intermediate levels of a language with practical exercises that put the grammar to use through conversations. BABBEL is the only recommendation in this post that is paid, but if you want to try a free month of BABBEL, send me a message and I can send you a referral :)

**Bonus tip for those who know multiple languages:** As you learn a new language, learn it through the lens of another language you already know. For example, I'm currently learning German through French on Babbel, so as I'm learning German, I'm also reviewing my French at the same time.

I hope you've found some of these tips helpful! Let me know which ones you've already tried and which ones you've liked or disliked. I would love to hear your tips for language learning as well!

Reading Grimm Stories to Learn German,I am a B1 German learner and am looking to expand my reading input.

App that reads/pronounces a chosen word aloud?,"Hi.  I'm currently learning Italian and would like some sort of app that would allow me to choose (eg.  via highlighting) an Italian word in Chrome and read it out loud, so that I know how it is pronounced.  Text to speech.  

Currently I have Wordreference on my phone, which provides a ""Wordreference"" menu button that I can hit after highlighting any word in Chrome, but the problem is that for many words, there is no audio pronunciation.

I also have Google Translate on my phone, which will pronounce any word, but I've got to type the word into that app, press enter, and then press the audio play button, so it's a lot of steps.  I'm looking for something that is easier and quicker to use directly from the web browser.

Do you mean you want to be able to read native texts, but don't care if you can speak it? If so, that's what I've done, and I did it by reading a ton, going from easier things (YA fiction) to harder things (halfway through also sprach Zarathustra at the moment) I did it in two years, and don't need a dictionary now for the most part, which is pretty great. \n\nIf that's your goal, and you decided to learn like I did (volume of comprehensible input) then the best app is going to be one that answers any questions as quickly as possible, allowing you to make note of anything new, correct any grammatical misunderstandings, and move on. Readlang is great for that. You can do a multi-word phrase lookup (using Google translate) with a single click and drag of the mouse, and you can have single word lookups use any dictionary of your choice. I've been using it for Russian, and it's very helpful to have it pull from a dictionary with declension tables. It's all about speed of answering questions, and then covering ground. \n\nA kindle is a great tool too, though it doesn't work well for compound nouns (things like \nNutzungsbedingungen) or verbs with that floating first syllable that goes to the back of the sentence sometimes (aussteigen = er steigt aus). Even with those weaknesses though, the kindle was a great tool when I was first getting started. I like it more than readlang even, just because I spend enough hours staring at a computer screen for my work. \n\nSo... yeah, check out readlang. I would also heavily encourage you to spend your first 20~30 hours with graded readers so you can get a feel for the language without dealing with more complex grammar and vocabulary. Erste Stufe is an excellent intro, though it's a bit expensive since it's out of print. You can also go to a certain torrent site and look up 88 german graded readers and find what you're looking for there. \n\nIs that what you're looking for, or...?

Learning german from (basically) scratch by reading?,"So I have used duolingo for almost a year and had my level measured a few days ago, came to around 25% of the way to an A1 (I know its not much), but I will be starting formal lessons in January.

I have seen many talks by polyglots and also friends have recommended I should read, a German friend recommended two books (Der Besuch der alten Dame, and Die Welle), which seem so good! However some people advised me against reading them as they are not beginner books, and I might not learn anything or I might get frustrated.

In my experience, something that is kind of sleazy, but easy to read. Something that you'd probably be a little embarrassed about if someone found you reading it in your first language. A guilty pleasure genre, in other words. But definitely something originally in German!

A couple of reading suggestions for German beginners (x-post from /r/german),"In my search for reading material to help me improve my German I've found a few things that seem to hit the sweet spot, so I though I would share them as suggestions for other beginners.

**Ernst Gombrich - Eine kurze Weltgeschichte für junge Leser** - It's a brief summary of world history written for a young audience, but a lot of adults swear by it, claiming that it rekindled their passion for history. Gombrich's field was actually art history, but this work (born out of conversations with the daughter of his friends that made him realize that kids are able to understand more complex matters than we give them credit for, if they are presented in an interesting way) became the most beloved of his.

**Stephen King - Danse Macabre** - This book combines two qualities that are often suggested when the search for beginners' reading material is discussed: it is the translation of a bestseller (therefore the translators are instructed to use the simplest possible language in order to make sure that it can target the widest public) and it is some sort of biography (therefore there is much less variance in lexical register, plus it's much easier to fill with logic whatever escapes your reading comprehension) - except that it is about the formation of Stephen King's inner horror world rather than his outward life - which can be very interesting and at least a change from reading biographic books.

**Leonhard Thoma - Der Hundetraum und andere Verwirrungen** - This is a bit like cheating, because Thoma's books are explicitly intended for learners. However, unlike other books of this type, I find his very satisfying to read, and I am actually interested in following how the vignette will evolve. It reminds me a bit of those selected anthologies of short excerpts teachers used in middle school to improve/test our reading skills, but were so interesting that we ended up reading at home whatever we had skipped in class.

Since I was accustomed to read a few online newspapers at work between jobs, I also found helpful to switch to news in german:

[Nachrichtenleich](http://www.nachrichtenleicht.de/) is a weekly updated selection in simple language for learners. With as little a vocabulary as 1000-2000 words, you should be able to understand it without using dictionary.

For something more challenging, sometimes I read the [Süddeutsche Zeitung](http://www.sueddeutsche.de/). It definitely uses more than a beginner's vocabulary, but I can still follow it most of the times by looking up a word every couple of sentences. And the best thing is, I feel that all these words I have to look up are words that I will probably need. And it has the added benefit that you will see the world from a different perspective. 

Sometimes I'm left puzzled that they decided to focus on something that in my country would never be included in a news (not because it isn't relevant or interesting, but because, I think, every culture has his own unconscious maps of what can or cannot go in a certain medium). 

And if you are feeling like reading more diverse / lighter stuff , it has links to his [partner-magazine called ""Jetz""](http://www.jetzt.de/), which at this moment has articles like ""The connection between being a psychopath and staying friend with your ex"", or ""How did May come to be the official 'masturbation month'?""

Yet another post about language reading apps,"Hi everyone!

Lately, I've been reading a lot on my Kindle, but I can't seem to get over the fact that the experience is not quite what I'm looking for.

&#x200B;

I would like to find a reader that:

— lets me import a list of words that I already know (I would take it from Anki).

— recognizes different forms of a word and traces them back to its lemma (that's where the list would be really useful).

— highlights the words I have NOT seen yet in a text.

— lets me import big texts (books, for example).

— is free, or relatively cheap.

&#x200B;

Here's what I've tried so far.

&#x200B;

Readlang: Does none of the above, apart from the last one.

LanguageCrush: It highlights the words I've not seen, and it lets me import bigger texts, but I can't import a list of words I already know, and it doesn't lemmatize words.

Learning with Texts: Same as LanguageCrush, and the setup is a pain in the neck.

VocabTracker: It does everything I want, but it has a limit of only 30,000 characters per text. Also, the interface is quite clunky.

LingQ: It does all of the above, but the site is messy, and the price is quite steep.

Language learning saved my car during a home invasion,"My home was invaded recently, 5 people with machetes and crowbars held me down on the floor and demanded things, they took the keys to my car.

After the whole incident ended, I realised my car is still in the garage, door open and parking lights on, key in the ignition.

My car requires the clutch to be pressed down before it will start, if you try to start it like you would most cars, by turning the key, the car will spit out a message on the gauge cluster screen instructing you to press down the clutch.

BUT the thing is, I'm learning German, and for this reason I set my car's language to German, the message was in German, kupplung batätigen!!! (I'm in an English speaking country)

It appears that the dingus who tried to jack my car simply could not read the message, and therefore did not know how to start the car. The oxygen thief tried messing around with the light switch in his confusion as well, hence the parking lights.

So it's definitely not something I would use regularly (I'd rather find a simpler text if I'm struggling *that* much), but I guess YMMV.\n\nIt also struggled a fair amount with the short text I put into it.

Having learned three languages as an adult (English, German, and Italian), I've developed and fine-tuned my methodology. With each language, it's becoming easier.

**Assimil:**

I'm always starting from there. It takes you from scratch to the A2/B1 level. But the real reason is, ""I just love it."" It's fun, easy, and efficient. The principle: you do one lesson per day for 90 days. That's it.

**Digital tool**

In parallel or just after, depending on my capacity, I start using few apps.

**Duolingo**

I do at least two lessons per day. (15 min). At the time I'm writing this article, I have a streak of more than 1,400 days.

**LingQ**

It's an app created by Steve Kaufman, a polyglot that speaks more than 15 languages. All is learned around the idea of ""content input.

**Anki**

This is the place where I keep all the vocabulary I want to review.

**As soon as I can read**

I Find content that interests me. I usually look for a blog on a topic I'm interested in. I then import the content in LingQ and do my morning reading there. (15 min). As of this writing, I have a 580-day streak.

Later I select a book I have already read in French or English, and I reread it in the language I'm trying to learn. As the last step, I start reading a book I've never read directly in the new language. Even if I don't understand everything. I read on the Kindle where I can quickly check a word or translate a sentence.

**In parallel to the reading, I listen a lot.**

I distinguish two parts — active and passive listening.

I do the active part at the beginning of the journey with Assimil and Pimsleur.

When I'm more comfortable, I move to the passive part. I do it in the car when I travel, iron, vacuum. Usually, I take the book I'm reading in the audible format, and I listen to it.

**Writing**

I write a few sentences every morning. In order not to add to my routine. I just transform my journaling experience into the language I learned. I use Languagetool and Deepl to help me correct my text.

I usually buy one good grammar textbook and I don't revise the grammar. I'm just checking the book when I observe that I'm always making the same errors to understand the explanation. It works much better for me than studying all the grammar concepts randomly.

**Speaking**

When I have acquired the basics and can start to express myself a bit. I'm starting to use Italki 2 times, 30 minutes a week.

I'm testing a few teachers until I find the right one. I found amazing teachers for German and Italian.

As soon as I have the occasion to, I practice in real life.

My main goal is to be able to communicate orally. It's more critical for me to convey my message even with mistakes (I do a lot) than to speak very slowly to say everything correctly.

**My personal experiences**

The method above has helped me to make tremendous progress in Italian and German. I concentrated each time one year in one language.

This year, I'm concentrating on German. I can manage a private discussion, read a book, listen to a podcast, and understand quite everything.

My weak point is impatience. I could practice in real life much more. But when I'm in a business setting, I do the small talk in the targeted language, and I'm too impatient to continue. As I'm in management, most of my counterparts also speak English, so I don't make enough effort to stay in the learned language.

Overall, the journey has brought me a lot of benefits.

**Direct effects**

I have progressed in my career, thanks to my ability to learn languages quickly. I have built great connections, met interesting people, and made new friends.

**The ripple effects**

I have developed my"" consistency, persistence and discipline"" muscles. I've developed new routines and improved my productivity in general.

I increased my knowledge of ""meta-learning,"" which helps me to understand how I learn. I can then apply it to any other field.

I developed my self-esteem and self-confidence. Keeping promises to myself, doing the work every day, seeing progress procures me joy and fulfillment.

Enjoy your learning.

I just finished reading my first book in German,"I've been ""learning"" German for about 2 years, but other than the beginning, here and there, and since about a month ago, I have been extremely lazy with learning and procrastinated a lot. Highschool not being great at teaching languages doesn't really help, as everything I was ""learning"" was stuff I already learnt in the first month on my own.

I didn't want German to be just another failed venture like my past languages.

I finally decided I'd set a goal and so started reading der kleine Prinz a few weeks ago. Brute forced ~last half of the book in the last few days because it's summer break. 

Great book, both story-wise and for learning. I've added 600+ words in my Anki deck that I previously didn't know, and am doing 25 new words a day at the moment.

Are there any books you guys suggest I read next? Intermediate stuff. I find children books and ""for learners"" books really dry in plot. I know Little Prince is a ""children"" book but it's enjoyable for adults too.

"After 13 months, I finally finished the Duolingo German tree! Here's my assessment of it and of how much I've learned after using it alongside Anki everyday. plus some other tips for anyone learning a language.","Warning: long read! You can skip everything and just read the last few paragraphs.

Hello everyone. I know there's some divide in the language learning community about Duolingo, with some people believing they'll become fluent after repeating ""Ich esse Brot"" 5 minutes a day and others saying its completely useless and boring drilling. I've been studying German for more than a year now, mainly using Duolingo, and I think I'm capable of shedding some light on the situation.

Background: I'm 23 years old. Other than my native language (Spanish) I only speak English. I had no prior knowledge of German whatsoever.

For the past 13 months I've been using Duolingo and Anki every day. I started with a 2000-words 'A1+A2' deck which then I merged with a 4k 'B1' deck. After finishing those I merged them again with a 12k B2 deck! At this moment I already have 7k 'mature' (words that I've mastered) and 3k 'young' words (words that I'm still learning). I'm yet to see the remaining 8k words.

I've used the web version of Duolingo on 'hard-mode'. That means you have to write the entire sentence down instead of just the missing word, and you can't use any word box. Duolingo used to make you to complete 60 lessons per skill, but later reduced the lesson number. I found it was harder to learn that way so I chose to keep doing 60 lessons for each skill (at least for most of them). That was hard because I had to keep track of how many lessons I'd completed so far. Most of the days I did between 4 to 16 lessons.

I used occasionally other apps like Clozemaster and Memrise, but Anki and Duolingo were the ones I used the most.

Six months ago I started to watch Netflix shows with German subs and audio (There's a fantastic app that let's you translate any language while watching Netflix at the same time, look it up). I also joined a German Whatsapp group (hallo wenn jemand das hier liest!), and try as often as possible to translate sentences to German.

So these are my results: I can understand most things written in German! I can read conversations and understand pretty much anything that is said in a casual convo. I can also read most newspaper articles and r/de threads. Granted, the level of the things I read is probably not too high. Like, I'm completely sure I wouldn't be able to read Kant lol. I watched ""Queen's Gambit"" ""Skins"", ""Easy"" and Star Trek Discovery"" and I could understand all the dialogues and follow the plot lines pretty well (although I still have to hit pause some times to read the whole sentence). On the other hand, watching other shows like 'The Crown' was much, much harder, and I think it's still a bit too much for my level.

My writing skills are obviously lower. I can express in a literal sense most of the things I'd normally want to say, but I don't know if that's how native speakers actually say it (although I'm getting better at it!). For example, someone whose native language is Spanish and is learning English might say some things like 'How many years do you have'? instead of 'How old are you?' because that's how you would say it in Spanish.

After checking the Goethe-Institut notes I believe I've mastered most of the A1-B1 grammar. I can use simple tenses and constructions (present, present perfect, präteritum, future, passive voice in the past and the present, etc), but I still don't know how to use the different subjunctives and the imperfects. I know by heart when to use each case, and I know how to decline every adjective. I know which articles require which case, strong vs weak nouns, comparatives, superlatives, etc.

All in all. I would say Duolingo is a tremendous asset if you want to learn a language. However, you have to use it properly, and it still wont make you fluent! Do the right number of lessons, because you are never going to learn grammar heavy skills if you only study those skills 10 times. It's very important that you use it alongside a vocab learning tool like Anki or Memrise, and that you immerse yourself in the language (after several months of studying, otherwise it would be pointless). Don't neglect your writing skills, because you can understand a language without being able to speak it (as a Spanish speaker, I can understand 90% of written Portuguese, but I don't know how to say anything).

Duolingo has some downsides too. I think the biggest one is that it doesn't force you to conjugate in different tenses most of the verbs you learn, and that it doesn't teach you prepositional adverbs (damit, darüber, davon, etc). If you want to, you should practice that by yourself.

CAN I SKIP BORING GRAMMAR? CAN I JUST LEARN BY MASS INPUT? The key to mastering a language is mass input and mass output, but you can't do that if you don't know anything lol. You can watch years worth of anime but you won't ever learn Japanese that way. You should study the old way (books, boring drilling) for one or two years before having fun with MASS INPUT. That doesn't mean you shouldn't get input earlier, but if you want to learn a language you'll absolutely have to study grammar the boring way.

ITALKI LESSONS WITH NATIVES FROM DAY ONE? If you want to, but I wouldn't. I've spoken with English natives less than 5 times in my life and I still speak English.

Anyway, thanks for reading that :) I hope I could help you if you are just starting learning a language. Now I'm gonna get an intermediate grammar book (any recommendations?), keep using anki, up my input, and will try to write a few pages every day.

I agree that Duolingo gets a bad rap, but it's important to come in with realistic expectations. I don't expect it to get me to fluency by itself, but it's a good way to get started with building a habit when you're clueless where to start. Then once you find your feet, you move on to more mass input methods. I've only been studying German for about 8 or 9 months, but I already feel pretty comfortable holding 30 minute conversations with my language partners on some simple topics, so I would guess that I'm roughly somewhere between A2 and B1. Maybe not the fastest progress, but still reasonably good for a hobby. :)"", ""The big question is: how many hours on DL/Anki did you need to reach the current level?\n\nWouldn't have a similar amount of time and level of effort worked out much more effectively in a traditional immersion course, yielding a much better ROI?"", ""I don't know if you are aware of this but you have just described the method that most polyglots would recommend to learn a language. You studied vocab and basically immersed yourself in the language ( watching media, reading, and participating in written convos).  I am sure that Duolingo had some effect on your abilities but from my experience with the App, I'd say that it's a complete waste of time after the first month of starting to learn a new language if you are a complete beginner to the world of language learning and that you would have reached the level you are in even if you've never used it. I know that Duolingo has a huge amount of vocab and some grammar lessons but you can learn all that and more much more efficiently from other resources, like Anki for example, and language books. The problem with Duolingo is it's designed in a way to maximize the number of times you watch the ads on the app if you are on the free plan or to get you to pay for the premium plan. The courses quickly become too repetitive and tedious to go through, not to mention the gamification aspects of the app which are designed to entice you to climb up the leaderboard, so if you are prone to competitiveness like I am, soon after starting using the app you'll find yourself spending much more time on the app than it's needed or is necessary, redoing previous activities just so you can stay up on top of the leaderboard. Gamification can be an awesome feature to help you learn when it's used properly but in the case of Duolingo, the way they designed it reminds me too much of the way gambling sites and casinos design their apps and games."", 'This was very insightful!

Because holy shit, my Spanish needs some serious work if I want to type out an article like that. \n\nWhen you learned English you didn’t just learn English. You learned how to learn a language. All those tools you used, mistakes you made, all come into play here. \n\nSpaced repetition (Anki) is one of the best ways to learn a language. Only second to real life experiences in my opinion. I’ll never forget when I went to work after my first day of Spanish and I asked my Mexican boss “Cuantos anos tienes” (How many assholes do you have)? Instead of cuantos años tienes. I have plenty of these stories. \n\nI started doulingo in spring of last year and was doing Pimsluer at the same time. I was swiping right on girls in Mexico City on tinder trying to talk to them to get immersion before one of them told me why don’t you try italki. I feel in love with italki and started taking Spanish lessons 5x a week. \n\nAfter I found italki I dropped doulingo. I can only say the cat cleaned the cows room so many times before I’m done with it. I’d rather learn about the culture and have fun. At this time I had finished 1 or 2 out of the 7 sections off doulingo for Spanish. \n\nSo after about 5 months of italki lessons I returned to doulingo and took a placement test. I got a couple questions wrong about vosotros and I spelled one of the words wrong that I know how pronounce, but got wrong on paper. That placed me 6/7 units with only one remaining after the placement test. \n\nEven with words that I didn’t know it was just way too easy with doulingo. I could click through them brainlessly. I feel like it’s a waste of time. A native speaker could finish the doulingo tree in five minutes by taking a placement test.\n\nI strongly recommend Pimsleur and italki about after about a month of exposure. Fire your teachers if they spend too much time talking to you in your language and try to have more than one teacher. Men and women talk about different things, so talk to both. \n\nI’m 9 months in my journey and went to Mexico a couple weeks ago. My data plan wasn’t working and I couldn’t call Ubers or use a translator to help me with words without connecting to wifi my whole vacation.

So in that sense, I think, Duolingo is absolutely ideal, and probably why so many people do have a negative opinion of it.\n\nThat being said, I don\'t think I\'ve ever finished a tree.

This has also been the experience of many other successful learners.\n\nInput / Immersion can be done from day 1, as long as it is comprehensible. For the most common languages, you can easily find YouTube channels that offer beginner comprehensible input about various topics. (Here's a great example of that in Spanish: [**https://youtu.be/gqkTtM629W4**](https://youtu.be/gqkTtM629W4)**).** You can learn from those, both consciously and subconsciously.

It's definitely useful to learn some grammar, it's gonna speed up the process a bit, but it's just a mean to make the content you consume more comprehensible and therefore make the most out of your input.

Have most of the schools and apps gotten it completely backwards?,"I've studied a bit of linguistics a long time ago but I never came across even **comprehensible input.** Not only that but I never saw those ideas propagated in schools:

1. read content that's not too easy and not too hard
2. native speaker content only
3. focus on the input (reading and listening) not the output (writing and speaking)
4. free choice of content to follow your interests

When thinking about it, I realized every time I've successfully learned a language, I've actually acquired it subconsciously (through comprehensible input and free choice). Estonian from my home, English from the TV, German from living in Germany. Plus I've picked up some others a bit - Finnish, Russian, French etc.

It's also kind of a no-brainer that you need comprehension (from reading and listening) before you can say anything. A no-brainer after you've realized you've been wrong the whole time, that is lol (I spent nine years learning German the traditional way and didn't even get close to fluency).

Yet I see most schools and apps still doing the opposite. Focusing on grammar, curricula, empty repetitions, meaningless exercises, and ""real life scenarios"" that are made up (how are they real then exactly?). Duolingo even brags that they align with CEFR plus they lock you into a curriculum - basically trying to standardize your interests while feeding you bite-sized fake situations.

Is it just me who's seeing it?

Krashen coined the term in his *Input Hypothesis* as part of his theory of second language acquisition, which emphasizes the importance of exposure to language that is slightly beyond the learner's current proficiency level but still understandable **(comprehensible input)** for effective language acquisition."", 'The English grammar/syntax errors in this post (e.g. ""I\'ve studied a bit linguistics"") aren\'t exactly a ringing endorsement of \'subconsciously\' acquiring grammar/syntax.', 'So, in a research study conducted by Brabham et al. (2002), the researchers wanted to assess the efficacy of rapidly fostering a lexicon in school children through the three varying methods (given children acquire about ~2,000 words a year at that age, it is a great group with which to research the cognitive acquisition of language):\n\nMethods:\n\nGroup 1: teacher just read the story to children (immersion approach)\n\nGroup 2: teacher conducted a discussion before and after reading the story (performance reading)\n\nGroup 3: teacher made it interactional (engaged in discussion with the students throughout the entire course of the story)\n\nResults:  \nGroup 1: learned 1 or 2 new words\n\nGroup 2: learned 3 or 4 new words\n\nGroup 3: learned ~5 new words\n\nThe results were highly significant and have held up repeatedly; per the research, the immersion approach is unfortunately far too passive a process for rapid learning.\n\nBy the way, Finnish is my first language; very cool you have learned some! That is not frequent to hear :)\n\nETA: I apologize for the horrid formatting; it looks fine on my phone until I post :(\n\nETAx2: Oh, with the conclusion of the study being that active learning via continual contextual cues and feedback is how children most rapidly learn, retain and correctly use new words. At the age we are most rapidly developing our vocabulary bank, the immersion approach in and of itself often lacks the context necessary for the learner to comprehend what is actually being discussed.', 'I did comprehensible input for Thai and it was amazing. I did look up some words when I heard them frequently and still couldn’t catch their meaning, and I looked at some very basic grammar. But fortunately there is 1000+ hours of comprehensible input for Thai on YouTube ordered by level, and it absolutely does work IF the input is mostly comprehensible.', 'My very first Spanish teacher greeted our classroom in Spanish, and started giving commands in Spanish, like a game, making us figure out what he meant. He was awesome. Unfortunately he was also constrained by school board testing standards on what he was ""supposed"" to teach, versus what actually worked. It\'s a systemic problem from the very top.\n\nThe year after that, my second Spanish teacher launched into a day-1 English-based dissection of \'ser\' vs \'estar\'. Everyone\'s eyes glazed over immediately—school-based language learning at its finest.\n\nI read somewhere that this grammar-based method comes from classical education, when people were studying dead languages like Latin and Ancient Greek and a grammar-first approach made sense. Not so with people who want to actually \\*speak\\* living languages.', ""Comprehensible input is 100% the way to go, with various apps helpful to reinforce vocabulary when you don't want to or can't read a proper book or watch a program right then and there. (As in, when in a waiting room at the doctor's office or similar.)"", 'From personal experience, speaking Spanish to native speakers has been a key component to becoming fluent because it is putting what you have learned into practice and it helps you build vocabulary naturally.  Yes you need to build new vocabulary and you need to listen and learn grammar rules from apps/lessons so that you can understand people better.  Speaking it drives all you have learned into your brain and establishes it.  \n\nCrash course has a 16-video series on linguistics that I am going to be watching after Christmas.  That might answer some of your questions.', 'Any chance to add Chinese as an option?? Thanks', ""I think it makes sense that comprehensible input works. When you're a baby and a toddler, you learn from being immersed and your parents saying stuff to you that you have no idea what it is,but you then realise, 'ah that's a cup'. \n\nI do also think that learning grammar, whether it be after 100s of hours of comprensible input or just a bit, is still important, as we also do that with our native language."", 'I wish any of my language teachers mentioned immersion and the need to do it.', ""First - glad to take criticism from someone who hasn't even bothered to look lol.\n\nSecond - it's the job of the teacher to make it happen. The dumb thing to do is to just follow blindly some state-mandated program. You could replace it with an iPad and a Netflix subscription at age 4 and arrive at a better result in most cases. Personally I distinguish between teachers and instructors. A teacher follows blindly whatever is thrown at them, an instructor guides the person based on their interests. A teacher teaches one language, an instructor can help you get fluent in any language.\n\nThird - I agree.\n\nFourth - khmh, how about children? I don't know any babies who learned grammar.\n\nFifth - partly, sure."", ""Can. I mean it's kinda 90/10.

Cause the opposite sure as hell hasn't worked for me."", 'Just an FYI I’m not sure every FSI class is structured that way. I remember reading a post a couple months ago from someone who did spanish, and it was very CI focused, and not much emphasis on speaking at the beginning.', ""I know from personal experience that learning German for 9 years in school didn't get me to fluency. I picked up the language in a couple of months when actually living in Germany.\n\nI've seen literally hundreds of people who've learned English for 7-9 years in school and can barely speak about even the most basic topics.\n\nI'm not saying that grammar isn't necessary at all. Merely pointing out that a month of grammar is probably enough in the beginning. Can then slowly from time to time add some grammar but the main emphasis should be on input."", 'Sorry, can I ask what FSI and CI stand for?', 'Nr 1 - in the beginning, yes, I agree. The same as some grammar in the beginning is great. I don\'t see any point anymore for studying stuff like ""Where is the museum?"" tho.\n\nNr 2 - yep, I was mixing stuff there.\n\nRegarding nr 3 - my point was that the emphasis should be on comprehension. Not that you shouldn\'t need speaking or writing at all. Although if your goal is just to be able to read texts, you probably wouldn\'t need much of it.', ""I didn't call it a method as such but yeah I was mixing things a bit. The idea was to just point out that the traditional methods of language learning are kinda the opposite of getting comprehensible input in abundance."", ""Lol. It's normal to make typos or mistakes. Native speakers make them all the time as well. Especially when you listen someone speak - they change the topic, break sentences, backtrack, etc. I don't know where this grammar nazi attitude comes from but it's harmful for actual learning. Perfectionism is the killer of joy and progress."", ""I'm Estonian, so, need to thank the CIA partly for that (for building that big antenna in Helsinki during the cold war lol) and my dad who was a radio engineer and built a big enough antenna to receive the signal inland. Just went to see the new Kaurismäki yesterday. Could understand over half of it without translation :) Then again, his dialogues are very simplistic.\n\nI wish I had access to the full study, can't assess it properly otherwise.\n\nBut I see several problems there tho:\n\n1. the teacher chose the timing\n2. the teacher chose the story\n3. the teacher chose the method\n4. the teacher chose the target group\n\nSo, essentially, the children were stripped of all agency.\n\nIt's a typical problem with any kind of research in social sciences. They create artificial situations and then apply it to real life as if the situation hasn't changed. But there are many assumptions built into artificial situations.\n\nI'd reword the conclusion a bit - the approach that worked the best was the one where children could participate and therefore they had a purpose.\n\nWhen someone else manages your time and chooses what you're interested in - it's not a good approach. You can never standardize interests nor choose who is interested in what at what time.\n\nIt's why most of the schools are largely just daycare centers where the children pretend to learn and the teachers pretend to teach. Or why procrastination becomes habitual - bc nothing makes sense *in a given situation for the given person*. 0.1% of the children might want to become geologists (in the future) and learn about the layers of rocks around the earth surface, but the rest are just pretending to be learning and cramming for the test (after which they will forget).\n\nIt's similar with language learning I think. We study these artificial situations that actually have no meaning but then forget that life doesn't actually contain artificial situations.\n\nThe forgetting curve is a great example of rubbish research. Yes, if you memorize meaningless word combinations, it might predict something. But compare it to remembering the address of your new house - do you really need to be exposed to it 8 times over time to remember it? Probably not. You'll remember it immediately bc it's meaningful. We can't manufacture meaning."", 'In my first English class I spent 10 minutes arguing with the teacher whether it\'s ""color"" or ""colour"" (the pronunciation not the spelling). Apparently neither of us got the point that these were just different dialects and both are fine.', 'In the like, third year of Spanish class our Spanish teacher played Destinos all year.\n\n.... Destinos is not CI... and the most insulting thing is Destinos 100% believes its CI. (Which reminds me I was doing an experiment and I forgot about it...)', 'I will in the future. The tokenization (splitting text into words and sentences etc.) works differently in many Asian languages. Need to first perfect it for the languages that work similarly, then can expand.', 'Yep, I\'m not against grammar. But I\'m for changing the weights.\n\nI don\'t like the term ""immersion"" that much anymore. I used to use it lot. But it misses the essence of the concept a bit.\n\nWhy babies learn is not immersion as such. It\'s that there\'s a purpose to that immersion. They need to express their own needs and wants through the language. And  figure out what\'s going on.\n\nThis is why I brought up free choice based on your own interests. Cause essentially you\'re expressing your own needs and wants (by choosing the stuff you\'re actually interested in) and that\'s why you learn. That gives you the extra motivation. That need could be even as silly as ""I\'m bored, I wanna see something funny"".\n\nI\'ve seen a huge difference with Duolingo and the content I consume freely (nevermind whether it\'s in my app or just watching YouTube in Spanish). In Duolingo, nothing has a purpose or meaning. So, I kinda glide over the content without actually properly processing it. I just want to get the answer right. In the content I choose to consume freely, the meaning of the content matters more than getting some word 100% correct. But eventually I will get it right of course. But I\'m not stressing over it and trying to understand 100% of the words every time.\n\nbtw I was assuming above that you\'re using immersion in the looser sense (not in the narrow definition of taking classes in a foreign language).', 'Most people on here are zombies who love traditional learning. It’s only once you experience the power of comprehensible input that you even BEGIN to value it sadly. Thanks for noticing though and trying to be the solution instead of the problem.', 'This entire sub has years of discussion of all aspects of input-based approaches.', 'I saw that he said class time for Spanish was different than other languages and during the class it was most CI and homework was less.  I am not sure how accurate that is.  It certainly doesn’t match what the DLI recent people have told me.  From what they said, the heavy use of CI would be more in the homework.  The caveat is he said it was specifically Spanish and I don’t know anyone that has gone through Spanish.  \n\nBut I am sure that it does not remotely match what many post as their CI method.  \n\nDo they use CI materials?   Absolutely.  Everyone should.  Do they use the CI method of nothing but CI everything including grammar to teach?   I am pretty sure they don’t.  Do they delay speaking, reading, and writing till they have hundreds or even a thousand hours like some suggest?  Absolutely not.', 'The other way of looking at it is you had grammar and classes and everything but were missing the time spent hearing and speaking the language.   Then you did immersion which favored what you were weak in.', 'Sure.  CI is Comprehensible Input and depending on context it is a methodology based on Krashen’s Comprehensible Input model for second language acquisition.   The idea is that you acquire a language by input and nothing else.  Study, speaking, grammar, etc do not help at all.  Comprehensible Input is also simply input, either listening or reading, that you can comprehend.    The importance of which can’t be overstated.  We had hieroglyphics for centuries, but until the Rosetta Stone, we could do nothing with it.  It made small pieces comprehensible so that other pieces became comprehensible and so on.  \n\nFSI is the Foreign Service Institute and is the agency of the US government that is responsible for training diplomats and consular staff and others in foreign languages.  Related to the FSI is DLI which is the Defense Language Institute which does less speaking focus and lots of additional military stuff.  They use the same methods and similar goals.  They are pretty much the gold standard in language training.  They also do a lot of research and comparisons on language learning.  \n\nAdditionally, very old (1960’s) recordings and materials from FSI are available as public domain for many languages.  You can download them and use them.  They are not fun and are challenging, but are great courses.', 'FSI = Foreign service insitute, responsible for training the US foreign service.

Maybe you meant they are ""different""?', 'It\'s more than typos though. You mix tenses in the first sentence and ""you need: 1) read..."" sounds immediately awkward', 'Some of us need to actually know our language for professional reasons so having proper grammar instruction along the way is crucial.

I'm now using Busuu and Anki as my main (APP) learning, around 20-30 minutes per day between them.\n\nAs for watching videos, I use YouTube a lot, listening to basic stories, podcasts and a channel called, 'learn Spanish' who teaches you how to string sentences together, this has helped a lot.\nDreaming Spanish is probably one of the best ones for watching videos on, as you can select the difficulty of the video and it counts your hours and has a guideline for how long it should take and where you should be at by that point.\n\nI feel like Duolingo is very gamified, which in some ways helps, but in others it doesn't, as you end up worrying about placing high on the leaderboard"", ""Thank you for the encouragement :) It's pretty rare nowadays."", ""You need both. But I think the problem is that motivation works in the opposite direction. I wouldn't want to have my first exposure to basketball through doing suicide runs."", 'Ah I see, thanks a lot for the detailed explanation, I appreciate it! :D', 'Ah, thanks a bunch! :D', ""Seems I need to be more precise with my language. Yes, I agree. You'll continue looking up stuff. I even do it sometimes for my native tongue. But don't need it that much after the initial month or two. Then it's more like a bit here and there."", ""I meant the opposite:\n\n\\- consciously learning vs unconsciously acquiring\n\n\\- forced curricula vs free choice\n\n\\- made up dumbed down texts vs native speaker content\n\nBut it's a spectrum. No method/program/app usually falls completely only on one side. Even with language acquisition you kinda have to think consciously what a word could mean sometimes etc."", ""Sure, some do. But not everyone.\n\nI remember when I had to send my first business emails to some clients in the UK. I studied the email formats etc. I was super nervous. In the end you realize it's mostly bs - if the person gets stuck too much with the form and doesn't see the content, then he's not worth dealing with anyway. Tho yeah, every sector etc has their own lingo and it's not necessarily a bad thing to show you belong to the same group.\n\nMy guess is they read below a 6th grade level *precisely* bc they were forced to study grammar instead of letting them choose what they want to read and do.\n\nIt's kinda the same in math. 95% of the people I talk to say they're bad at math. Yet I haven't seen a single school that actually instructs students on math. They force you to memorize algorithms, but I've yet found a school that actually teaches math. The same thing with reading - memorizing grammar rules is not necessary to read your mother tongue. It's bad instruction. It works the other way around. You might become interested in grammar after you've had a chance to read something interesting."", ""Sorry, I meant the researcher. I was just thinking about the broader school system where this usually happens bc of the teachers (or state). But the same point.\n\nThanks for the link.\n\nThis study tries to optimize something that shouldn't exist. The factory approach of standardized curricula with same-age groups and no agency. If the goal is to prepare children for real life, then I don't know any companies that only hire people born on the same year. Nor are there situations where you can't choose what you want to work on (except in prison or dictatorships). Nor is it possible to start businesses where agency is not required. Asking questions yourself is way more important than answering the questions someone poses to you. Ofc, in school, you're not allowed to question the  questions.\n\nI think Montessori proved this already 100 years ago that all children really need is free time, mixed age groups, access to materials, mentors and instructors. And no standardized curricula nor forced lesson times etc. The compulsory schooling setting makes no sense unless we want to end up with people who are dumber after graduation than before graduation.\n\nAnything that tries to remove agency from children has the opposite effect of true education imo. George Land did an interesting [study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfKMq-rYtnc&ab_channel=TEDxTalks) on it.\n\nBut agency requires trust - something that the state does not have. The same with language acquisition - we need to trust our brain to pick up the language subconsciously. I can't really force my subconscious to do anything.\n\nSo, yes, I agree, having a conversation increases understanding. But the study settings are artificial and have too many wrong assumptions built into them.\n\nDeep learning only happens based on interest (which usually also means free choice). I don't know any counter examples to that. And when you have the chance to read something interesting you naturally want to discuss this with someone. You don't need to be forced to do it. So, the role of the mentor is to create an environment where you have access to people with whom you could discuss stuff. I think that's one of the few things valuable in a university setting.\n\nBtw a sample group of 96 children can't be possibly statistically valid when you have so many variables. The differences in results would have to have been like 2-3x in that case. But yeah, the study is not even asking the right question imho, so, it's kinda besides the point.\n\nAbout the shared reading (mentioned in the study)... Have you tried using apps like Tandem? I was surprised to see that the audio rooms were so unpopular. But it got me thinking that the problem might be that there's no shared interest (except language learning). I wonder if building something where you can discuss things around a certain topic makes more sense (discuss articles, events, books etc.).\n\nHope this is not too much of a rant :) But I generally tend to disregard a lot of research cause they are not asking the right questions and are not thinking outside the current system."", ""I think Duolingo is great for getting hooked in the beginning.  But yeah, gradually it becomes too competitive but also repetitive.\n\nI've come across Dreaming Spanish before but didn't try it out yet. Will have a deeper look."", 'I would look at drills on passing and dribbling being the doing of grammar.  The CI method being watching a game.', ""Hey look, I don't want to be rude but I don't think there's really any other way to say this.\n\nFrom your responses, I can tell you're not understanding what I'm saying, and from your original post I can tell you haven't done much research into what comprehensible input actually is or how it helps. It isn't sitting and looking things up with a dictionary. You should probably nail those things down before you go and spam promotions for your premium chatgpt startup that does nothing that Lute doesn't do better for free."", 'First of all, professional goals ≠ sending shoddily worded emails. I am an international lawyer and the command one needs to have over the French language in this field is demanding. \n\nDo you seriously think I would be better served by never studying French grammar and just winging it? \n\nAgain, even in highly educated countries most people have poor grammar. And you’re saying by emulating them rather than studying the correct rules I will somehow attain better grammar than they themselves have? I cannot understand that logic. It’s like saying learning to play basketball from 6th graders is all you need to make it to the NBA. who needs practice, repetition, and coaching when you can just *feel* the game.', 'Nice comeback! You\'re not completely wrong there.\n\nBut I think that you do actually pick up ""active"" skills though CI as well - bc of subvocalization, for example.', ""Correct me if I'm wrong then but comprehensible input is text (both written and spoken) that is just a tiny bit beyond the user's current knowledge. Whether you explain the missing bits through meta info or through translations, for example, carries little importance imho.\n\nLute - sure, it has similarities. But I wouldn't say a self-hosted service that is very technical is the same as a hosted service with pre-selected content and AI explanations plus a browser extension for doing reverse translations. It's like saying MySpace and Facebook are the same thing."", ""This explains a lot. Being a lawyer is a super specific job where wording plays a huge role. How many other jobs like that exist? Very few. Spoken word is way more important usually. Especially now with AI.\n\nI haven't said you should never study grammar. My point is the emphasis should be on following ur interests and reading and listening. You still need some grammar here and there as well.\n\nI've done a lot of different sports. And the worst coaches acted always the same - they overloaded you first with the rules and drills instead of letting you develop an interest in the game first and letting you play. So, a lot of people just quit. And rightly so.\n\nIn your case, you have a clear goal in learning grammar - for using it daily in your job. Your job literally depends on it probably. That's not the case for most people."", 'That is a thought.  So it might help with speaking and writing, but grammar is going to be pretty slow.', '>Whether you explain the missing bits through meta info or through translations, for example, carries little importance imho.\n\nYou also have to consider the underlying concepts. Comprehensible input works because you understand a sentence\'s message, and then also consumed the language at the same time, without thinking logically about or having to actively decode the linguistic components.\n\nIf you\'re missing words that you have to look up, you\'re not understanding the message. If you bring in logical analysis to apply a grammar rule or new definition to your sentence, then you\'re no longer comprehending the original sentence either, you\'re reconstructing it into something that you understand, but that isn\'t the original input. This isn\'t using meta information to understand, you\'re just making a translation and understanding the translation.\n\nNow, if you went in later, reread it, remembered the meaning and context, and then consumed the original input, that would be valid, but that\'s not usually what happens with this kind of app. \n\nAnd beyond that, the concept of comprehensible input as described by Krashen is not ""text (both written and spoken) that is just a tiny bit beyond the user\'s current knowledge"", it\'s text where the message is obvious and understandable to the reader despite there potentially being linguistic unknowns. If you need to look things up to understand what\'s going on, it\'s not traditionally considered comprehensible input to boot.\n\nYour app isn\'t encouraging comprehensible input, it\'s encouraging intensive reading. That\'s something that may be valuable depending on what researchers you read but is nevertheless not comprehensible input.', 'Tons of other jobs exist where accurate language matters. I butt up against them every day. Regardless, wouldn’t even “mere” hobbyists prefer eventual mastery? If all they ever did was CI, eventually they would run out of things to learn. Then what? Another language is the answer for some, but many don’t want to just abandon a language they got so far in. All that grammar study they’ve been putting off is now knocking on the door. \n\nYou might be appealing to the wrong sub as I’m sure you’ve gathered based on your reception. The vast majority of people here are pretty serious learners who do not want to merely “get by” in a language. Can the DuoLingo method be improved upon? Absolutely. But no one here is preaching that app as the end all be all. We are all well aware of CI but we also all understand grammar study (like vocab and speaking study) is a necessary chore we just have to slog through.', 'Yeah, I think the same actually.\n\nYoung children don\'t have conscious thought. So, the method of studying something consciously is not available to them anyway.\n\nAdults have conscious thought (mostly) but I\'ve got a feeling that it\'s the case of ""when you\'re holding a hammer everything looks like a nail"". Meaning that we\'re (over)doing it just because we can.', ""Aren't you also looking up the meaning through meta info? Krashen literally describes showing images or visual cues to make input comprehensible. That's basically looking up the meaning from outside the text itself. That's exactly what explanations and translations do. I don't think it matters if you use body language, pictures, situation, or translations/explanations - these are all outside the actual text.\n\nSometimes I'm watching Spanish videos with Spanish subtitles and I can't tell from the audio and video what they're talking about. But then I look at Spanish subtitles and I recognize the word bc it's similar to an English one. Is that not comprehensible input as well?\n\nMaybe the question is around timing. You can consider the input comprehensible when the processing is taking place more or less at the same time (but through different senses). So, body language and spoken text can be processed perhaps more closely together in time (audio + visual), while looking up translations and explanations have a delay between them (visual ... visual). But I don't think that's how Krashen actually defined it. Doesn't mean we should stick with his definitions and work only ofc.\n\nI think also that after looking up the meaning of some words, you will re-read the text. Maybe not always but often enough. Because the texts are based on *your* interests - so, you do want to comprehend the whole meaning not just the meaning of a word. It's not a random graded reader with some random text inside that has no connection to your immediate situation. At least I do re-read sentences quite often. Can't yet speak for everyone.\n\nNote that the app is not purely for just encouraging intensive reading imo. You can filter the content by % of new words and your interests. Both make it easier to read. If I read an article about the Ukraine war, I can pretty easily guess what's going to be inside the article. If I read an article about cattle farming methods in Peru, I have no idea where it's going to go. Also, the format itself makes it easier to guess what the text will contain and mean.\n\nThe same applies to the extension - it translates text on websites you visit only when it contains enough of the words that you understand. The rest of the text is kept in the original language.\n\nI will go over Krashen's work and language acquisition research in general once more soon. Good discussion, thanks!""]"

Your favourite iOS reading app?,"I used to use MoonReader on Android and enjoyed using it a lot (I could highlight words, make notes, tap a word and it'll link to my selected dictionary's definition of the word, etc.), but I have yet to find something similar for iOS.

I just read 4 books in my target language and progressed a lot! I want to share my experience.,"Reading books in foreign languages is my favorite way to build vocabulary. There are many ways to improve language skills, but practice in any form is essential—this can be reading texts, watching movies, listening to podcasts/audiobooks/anything, having conversations, and so on. For me, tracking progress is easiest when reading, and I want to share my experience.

Recently, I finished reading a series of four books in German ([https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074CHF991](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074CHF991)) - this is a translation of the Russian series ""Страж"" by Alexey Pehov. By the way, he is one of my favorite modern Russian fantasy authors. I read this series a long time ago (the last book was published about 10 years ago, I think), but a few months ago, I stumbled upon the German translation and decided to re-read it - this time not just for fun, but also for language practice. Pehov writes excellent books, rich in descriptions, which makes it quite challenging when reading them in translation.

It took me over a month to read the first book, and I marked about 1.5k words as unknown on my Kindle (looking up their translations). The first third of the book was very difficult, but it gradually became easier and easier. I read the second book a bit faster, but it still took about a month, with around 1.1k new words. It got better with the third book—about three weeks (\~900 words), and only about ten days for the fourth (\~500 words). Of course, external factors affected my reading speed, but the progress is evident.

In general, it helped me not only with vocabulary, but also with formulating my thoughts.

I then transferred all these words to Anki.

Next, I plan to read something originally written in German (in addition to other practice methods).

P.S. The covers of the German editions are simply gorgeous

"How I passed the C1/C2 exams in three languages: English, Finnish, and German","A few people have wanted me to share how I reached a certified C1+ level in three languages. Unfortunately for me, this is not the story about how I, using great methods and well thought out language hacking plans, quickly mastered three languages. Hopefully some of you might still find it useful to see a perhaps more realistic example of somebody trying and failing for decades, but still persisting and somehow succeeding in the end.

**The exam**

I took the Finnish YKI-exam in all three languages and this link should lead to a copy of my certificates as well as the CEFR conversion sheet that was included with the certificate: [https://m.imgur.com/a/6xxk1vv](https://m.imgur.com/a/6xxk1vv) In case someone has trouble viewing the file, I achieved a C2 in Finnish and German listening comprehension, English speaking, and English and German reading comprehension. The rest of the skills, including writing in all three languages, were at a C1 level.

**How I learned German**

I was born in Germany and lived there during the first few years of my life, exposing me to the sound of the language from an early age, but I had not yet started speaking German when my family decided to move to Finland. For some years, the only exposure I had to German was the occasional movie. My dad went on business trips to Germany quite often and used to bring home German VHS tapes and I grew up thinking that Disney movies were all originally in German. It's difficult to say how much I actually understood of those movies, but I at least learned the valuable lesson that many children will happily watch movies in foreign languages. At some point, my parents placed me in an evening German class for children (maybe around the age of eleven?) for perhaps a year, but the only thing I remember from that class is the word for turtle, which I sadly have not had much use for yet.

When I was fourteen, I chose to sign up for German classes at school and I continued taking classes for five years. The previous exposure I had had to German definitely helped because German was easier for me than it was for my peers and I ended up graduating with the highest possible grade (Laudatur for those familiar with the Finnish education system). I foolishly thought I spoke German, but was rapidly brought back to Earth when I decided to take part in an exchange program (Erasmus) to Germany. I quickly realized that despite my good foundation and good grades, I still could not keep a conversation going in German and barely understood anything people said when they spoke at a normal speed. Something had to be done and out of the options available to me I chose the possibly worst option ever: speaking English with almost everyone.

The three months I spent in Germany during my first exchange were not a complete failure from a learning perspective though, because I due to utter boredom ended up reading many books in German simply to entertain myself while I spent the evenings in a room alone with no TV or internet, not knowing anybody in the entire country (until I made some friends speaking English). At first I tried to use a dictionary to look up the words I did not understand, but there were too many, so I eventually gave up and kept reading even though I far from understood everything. It would probably have been smarter to start with material more at my level, but instead I started reading German translations of Stephen King books. Boredom is a great motivator and after the first few books, I started understanding more and more. Realizing that I had trouble with even forcing my mouth to pronounce the German words that I did know, I decided to read out loud. This turned out to be a very good idea and I still frequently do this in the languages I study. Techniques like shadowing and echoing are a lot better for improving your pronunciation and accent, but I found that reading out loud helped me with remembering words and expressions and later actually using them in speech.

The second time I went to Germany for a language exchange, I completely changed strategies. This time around, I completely refused to speak any English with anyone. This certainly forced me to learn listening comprehension and speaking quicker, but I later found out that it led some people to think that I was mute because I frequently could not think of anything to say and just stared at people. This is not a method I would recommend for making friends. This time around, I luckily had a TV to keep me company and found that it is actually possible for an adult to learn how to understand a language that they have some basic to lower intermediate skills in by binge watching TV. I barely understood anything during the first hundred hours or so, but eventually things started making sense. I was also lucky enough to have a neighbor who did not speak any English, so I actually had to communicate in German without being able to fall back on English if things got too complicated.

Unfortunately, I had to go and ruin the great progress I was making in German by meeting, falling in love with, and marrying a native English speaker. As a result of this, I neglected German for a few years while I was busy being lovingly ridiculed for all the mistakes I made in English (turns out that just because you see a word written several times, this does not automatically mean that you know how to pronounce it). Luckily, I discovered italki and found a great tutor to practice with for a while. Then I forgot about German again for a few years, just occasionally reading some articles, watching some TV shows or listening to some podcasts. For a while, I used Glossika daily for German and a few other languages, but eventually stopped doing this as well.

Still, even with this very infrequent exposure to German for very many years, it seems like my skills did not deteriorate too much and I still managed to get C2 in listening comprehension and reading comprehension (surprisingly, because I did not have time to answer the last two questions in the reading comprehension exam so I guess you do not have to have a perfect score). Even though I don't think I have had a real conversation in German for more than three years, I still managed to get a C1 in speaking part of the exam, even though I actually managed to start the interview by forgetting the German word for exam. But wait, you may think, what about writing? She did not mention practicing writing anywhere in this wall of text. That's correct, I actually did not practice writing. I don't think I have written anything resembling an essay or the type of tasks in the writing part of the exam since 2004. Turns out that if you have a high enough level in reading comprehension and have had enough input, it is possible to get a C1 in writing without actually practicing this skill.",https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/kn8ga4/how_i_passed_the_c1c2_exams_in_three_languages/,734,75,"["">. This time around, I luckily had a TV to keep me company and found that it is actually possible for an adult to learn how to understand a language that they have some basic to lower intermediate skills in by binge watching TV.

I was also lucky enough to have a neighbor who did not speak any English, so I actually had to communicate in German without being able to fall back on English if things got too complicated.\n>\n\nThis is something that people need to hear more of. Just because you might not understand everything you are listening to doesn't mean it's not productive. If you give your brain enough input, it WILL start to figure out the language. Of course you can speed this process up by doing a lot of reading / conscious studying as well. Sometimes I feel like people on this sub would rather do anything, absolutely anything, than actually just listen to their target language.

I studied Finnish in school from the age of nine and my grades were actually quite good, but I still couldn't actually communicate with people in real life and had trouble understanding the language. I've looked at some approximated conversion charts and I think I at that point was around a B1-level, possibly a low B2-level after a few compulsory Finnish courses in university.\n\nAt this point I was very discouraged and didn't think I had any chance of actually learning the language to a (to me) acceptable degree. I had pretty much given up and spent a few years pretty much pretending to be a foreigner in front of Finnish speakers (which was easy because my name is not Finnish or Swedish and my husband is from the States). I didn't straight up lie, but didn't correct them when they made assumptions. Lying by omission I later found out is the expression for that. \n\nAt this point, I had moved to an area with a majority of Finnish speakers, so I was passively exposed to the language a lot more. Still, I mostly interacted with Swedish or English speakers and most services I needed were also available in Swedish, so my exposure to Finnish was quite limited. There were things that were poorly translated or simply not available in Swedish though, so I found myself more and more frequently using the original Finnish source to look up important information. At first it was mostly in written form, but then I started to feel a need to understand more and more of the spoken language as well and thus going out of my way to get more input.\n\nThis lead to me having a quite strange level of Finnish, where I was confidently reading quite complicated texts at a C2 level, but sounded strange during the rare moments when I attempted to speak. It was only now that I actually started incorporating the techniques I had used while studying other languages and started studying Finnish more actively. I started watching TV shows and reading non-fiction in Finnish. I also started reading the news in Finnish every day. I started speaking Finnish, actually first with language learners and not native speakers because I was more comfortable doing this. I didn't actually practice writing although this is recommended if you want to reach a C2 level. I only got to C1.\n\nIn hindsight, I should have incorporated TV shows and non-fiction much sooner. If you're working on getting from B1-C2, I would actually recommend using perhaps even the majority of your time on this type of input because if you focus too much on reading and more formal speech, you'll end up sounding strange when speaking yourself. There aren't very many learning resources for this level anyway (if any). Subtitles are ok in the beginning and it's good if you vary the material (TV shows about different topics, soap operas, movies, talk shows, cooking shows, the news, documentaries, audiobooks...). Only after a solid listening comprehension level, I would move on to focusing on reading. I think I made it way too difficult for myself by skipping the TV show phase of language learning and going straight to very advanced material that I needed to understand. Having a need to understand the language is a very effective motivator though."", ""True, but once you break through and start understanding the story (while still missing a lot), it becomes a lot more fun and easier to get more hours in.

Which language would you say has some of the best literature that you can read?,"I'm looking to learn a new language, and I already speak English, Spanish and Italian fluently and I live in the UK. I'm looking for a new challenge and would prefer not to learn another Romance language, but I would love to learn a new language for the purpose of reading literature - speaking to people in the language wouldn't be as important. 

Ideally I'd like it to be accessible in its literature. For example, if I learn Modern Greek will it be easy to read Ancient and Koine Greek? Or if I were to learn Russian, how difficult is it to transition to reading Dostoyevsky?

Of course these are only examples, but what would you suggest as having rich literature including culture, philosophy, history, and something that can enrich my life in some way?

The first ones that come to mind would be Greek, Russian, German, Arabic (although there are so many dialects), Chinese and Latin. 
Do you think any of these would be good? 
Are there any others that I haven't mentioned that you think would be good?

Edit: Thank you for your responses! After reading all the comments, I'm thinking either German or Russian. What I'm curious about is how much more rewarding would it be to read these languages compared to translations? Does anyone who's studied one or the other know how rewarding it feels?

You can't go wrong with any of these. \n\nThe famous classics, like Dostoevsky, are all accessible to speakers of modern Russian.

It's even difficult for modern greeks to comprehend ancient greek. Koine is much more understandable, still quite archaic though and people that are younger than say 20 have started understanding it much less than those in their 40s for example. We also have a bunch of Modern Greek literature classics that it seems to not be popular at all. Check out Kazantzakis and Karkvitsas.\n\nArabic: The issue about the different dialects comes to when you want to talk. If you want to read, you just learn the MSA (official Arabic language) and you're good to go. They also have a vast literature that I would like to explore as well but so far I honestly know nothing. I don't think you will ever regret learning Arabic.

I actually got a degree in Persian literature, but just from my own personal experience, I think the elephant in the room in this thread is English. I would probably not recommend Persian over English or a few other languages *to the average person*, however a lot of this discussion depends on what you are interested in. If you love Medieval poetry, for example, Persian is a veritable gold mine, though it is not the only language to offer that. I actually kind of struggle to think of anything Persian does distinctly better than some other language. (I get it, it\'s not a competition, and everything is interconnected.)\n\nTake modern literature for example. Like 99% of Persian books nowadays are translations of English books. Many of them are excellent. There are rare cases where a translation is known and celebrated as being even better than the original (like ""Hajji Baba of Ispahan""). If not translated, many modern works are essentially inspired by contemporary western literature, like Sadegh Hedayat and Forugh Farrokhzad were following European and American literary trends.\n\nI mean, even the classical literature was heavily inspired by Arabic literary styles and genres. I don\'t want to say it\'s derivative, but you really just have to have a special love for Persian to go to all the trouble (and it\'s a lot of trouble) to read it.\n\nAll that aside, what I would say in Persian\'s favor is:\n\n* The language is incredibly rich and beautiful. You shouldn\'t just read books in it; you should speak it. Speak it with children, speak it with scholars, speak it with the elderly. Pass it on to future generations.\n* Poetry is a key feature of the language\n* It is an essential pillar of culture. It\'s one of the most influential languages ever, particularly in the Muslim world. (Even Arabic has been influenced by Persian.) Most people alive on Earth speak Persian words sometimes in their own language. (This includes English, Chinese, Arabic, Russian, Spanish, and so on. Nearly all languages, but some languages like Turkish and Hindi are like 50% Persian at least.)\n\nI could probably say more, but these are some of the first things that come to my mind. It\'s one of the most underrated and ignored languages today.\n\nNow, if you want to read Persian to dive into literature, of course I\'m going to recommend poetry. Things I personally would recommend not sleeping on would be:\n\n1. The Khamsa of Nizami\n2. Conference of the Birds\n3. The Shahnameh\n4. Later poets like Sohrab Sepehri, Qeysar Aminpour, and Fazel Nazari\n5. Gulistan of Saadi (of course) AND his ghazals\n6. Saib Tabrizi\n\nThose are just my personal picks only, not a comprehensive list of everything good. (Hot take: Hafiz and Rumi are overrated. But if you had to pick one, pick Rumi.)\n\nAlso a lot of famous Iranian literati have badmouthed William Shakespeare. I don\'t agree with this; Shakespeare is just as good or better than any Persian poet. It\'s just that English has one Shakespeare, and Persian has like a hundred.

All of these, apart from Mihailo Pupin\'s book I mentioned are part of regular school curriculum. Truth be told, I had to search on Google ""najpoznatija srpska knjizevna dela"" to remind myself of some of these so I do recommend going by that simple way of looking into it (to put it simply, our literature and what should be considered the best of it is one of rare things most agree on lol Which is why there won\'t be a list about best Serbian literature without mentioning at least some of these! )\n\nSeobe by Milos Crnjanski is another one to be added to this list, you might like it if you\'re looking for historical aspect of things!\n\nNow, onto your question! Truth be told, I haven\'t read much of our works after high school (so the last 5 years or so), multiple reasons but one of the main ones is that I don\'t really know of anything good that has been written after Yugoslavia broke apart! Admittingly, I haven\'t looked too much into it!\n\nHowever, I do have some I could offer a few suggestions! Realism wise, wiki is your friend. I quickly checked the ""Knjizevni realizam"" in Serbian and most Serbian representatives there are ones we read back in high school! In no particular order, the most distinctive ones include: Милован Глишић, Лаза К. Лазаревић, Симо Матавуљ, Стеван Сремац, Јанко Веселиновић and Бранислав Нушић\n\nEven before looking at the list, I considered recommending Бранислав Нушић since his comedies are not only still funny, but they also have that \'anti-political\' zing which I consider timeless (he\'s a great figure to look into, he more often than not had issues with the King back then since, well, bro Nusic had no issues with throwing an occasional jab at him and anything related to the Kingdom! His fight with censorship is worth looking into)\n\nAnother great book to look into is ""Kad su cvetale tikve"" by Dragoslav Mihailovic. A real life inspired story about a life of a boxer back during and after WW2. It represents the life of a person back then quite nicely and in my opinion has a rather modern feel to it!\n\nThat\'s about it! I might\'ve overexplained myself a lil bit so as a TLDR: A simple, generic Google and/or Wiki search about the topic should yield great results since most staples of Serbian literature are widely accepted as such.', ""normally furigana is used to help readers in reading kanji, but then you have stuff like 技術不足 having the furigana へたくそ instead of ぎじゅつふそく (found this when reading a manga called wotakoi)\n\nas to the reason why they do this? idk but i think it's funny as hell xd"", ""Sure! I don't know what is your Turkish level but if you get to read Oğuz Atay, for sure you will see how powerful Turkish literature is. But his language and books are hard to understand even for natives sometimes. You have to have at least C1 level to read his books I think, or a solid B2\n\nSabahattin Ali is one of my favorite authors, he uses a kind of simple language to understand. \nsame goes with Halit Ziya Uşaklıgil, Reşat Nuri Güntekin.

What?', 'Lol WHAT? 😂😂', ""Because the spoken form is very different from the contemporary written form which is again very different from the written form found in old texts (lots of different vocab, sentence structure, etc) which imo makes it a much more demanding language if you want to be able to fully appreciate it.

Take the word « گل » for instance. Without context clues, how is one to know if I intended to write flower, or mud?

Still, Russian is an Indo-European language, and Spanish has helped me with that language a ton, whereas English sometimes is a lot different. \n\nI agree though, Spanish is fairly easy if you already speak Greek.

We can draw a distinction between ""normal"" curriculum for English speakers and foreign language studies. In classical education, an English speaker who went on to higher level studies was expected to have read books in Latin and Greek. That\'s the old education system that I mentioned, mainly for university-level. It\'s also useful for studying Christianity, which a lot more people did back then, and also things like European history and so on.\n\nLater on, these subjects were dropped for people who studied in any field. In general, US universities expect their students to know at least math and English, so with all the emphasis put on these, English is basically the only language you study in school. Literature includes both American and British literature, and to a lesser extent they also try to include international literature (in English).\n\nForeign language studies are popular and sometimes required depending on what and where you study. The modern philosophy regarding this is that students should study languages that are modern and popular, so instead of Latin you should study Spanish or French. (Definitely no Greek.) Greek is also a modern language, but it\'s not popular enough to be found in like 99% of US schools.\n\nSpanish, French, and German tended to dominate in our system because they are easy for English speakers, and they are either prevalent or historically connected to our populations. (Either widely spoken in US, or part of English or US history.) These are the big colonial empire languages of western Europe, basically.\n\nEverything else might be available if you are lucky. Like you might happen to be studying at a school that offers an Asian, African, or Native American language. Or even just a European language that\'s not like in the top four, would be pretty rare imo.', ""Yeah, you're right, there are a lot of words that are different. What I mean is, there are still a lot of words in Russian that I can figure out because I know Spanish. I would never have known words like мода if I only spoke English.

I guess it depends on your perspective. \n\nBut yeah, the cursive is cool—I'm still learning it."", 'You make a good observation about the use of such vocab in poetry, but I was thinking there are a lot of words in everyday speech like ""har"", ""hamesha"", ""shehr"", ""zindagi"", ""hafta"", ""sham"", ""mausim"", and probably like a hundred other examples that get daily use. But you\'re right, if it\'s very serious analysis then it probably won\'t reach 50%, although significant.', 'Awesome thank you!', ""Haha that's OK :) yes I will see what I can find. My best friend is learning Turkish, I find it really beautiful!"", 'For fantasy there are 我吃西红柿 and 唐家三少. None of them are perfect but if you accept that they could be a little juvenile at times it should be a good read. Their fics are sometimes even painstakingly translated into English so you could check those out as well if you need help. I don’t read much modern but there’s one recently that had me in stitches called 学魔养成系统, school-life focused. There’s a line in the epilogue that reads “it’s part of the plan”, obviously nodding at Three-Body Problem. Game-focused there’s The King’s Avatar (全职高手).

🥳 **Thanks**

Last year, I posted the [1.0 launch](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/u73x30/polygloss_is_out_at_the_app_store/) here and got a ton of helpful feedback! So I really wanna thank this community for helping me build a nice and useful language product.

The features I'm most proud of since the last launch are:

* Audio features (being able to send audio recordings instead of writing)
* Review (play mini-games with past-matches)
* Player statistics (see how many unique words you have used so far)

**💰Pricing**

The app is **free**, with an option for a paid subscription with extra features on the top. Because it's collaborative, critical mass important and I don't want to add a paywall from the get-go. Plus, I'm a firm believer in the transformative power of learning languages. I want to make it as accessible as possible for those who can't pay since everything I have in life I can confidently say it's thanks to having learned English and French. So there aren't any paywalls at the content level (all lessons are reachable from the free version).

**📚Languages**

Because the app is all image-based and the content is user-created, Polygloss supports ANY language. That means not just the most common ones like English, Spanish and French, but also minority languages, endangered languages, and dialects, like Welsh, Irish, Catalan, South Tyrolean German, Quechua, and many more! Players have used over 140 languages so far 😱

This past month the top languages were (in this order): Spanish, English, Welsh, French, Scottish Gaelic, German, Indonesian, Italian, Russian, Korean

💖

I would love if you left some feedback on the comments, especially on the points system and the balance between free and paid features, but any general feedback is useful and will make my day!

PS: I'm also launching on Product Hunt today, so if you want to tell me (and the rest of the world) what you thought of the app over there too here's the link: [https://www.producthunt.com/posts/polygloss-2](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/polygloss-2)

EDIT: Yo, y'all made my day with the amazing response to this post! Almost 200 people joined today and I never get this kind of traffic, this is awesome stuff. I'm so happy you liked the app 💖

Is it silly to read books in your TL that are not originals?,"Is it silly to read books in your TL that have been translated while you are fully capable of reading their original version. For example I can read Dumas and Verne in French, Dickens and Scott in English, and Dostoevsky with Bulgakov in Russian. 

But I read my favorite authors in my TL instead. A lot of people say I'm missing out, and should just find German authors, while I said that many books, Game of Thrones or Sherlock for example, I enjoyed reading them in German and I didn't care that I could just read them in English. A book is a book like I say. I only read in German anyways and I don't 'waste' time on reading in other languages so why should I limit myself to just German authors when I can read anything I want?

Plus, especially with older books, translation into contemporary German can just make it more pleasurable to read then original in outdated English.', ""It's not silly at all! After all, the natives read them too. Yes, there are better and worse translations, and we could always argue about the uniqueness of the original, but it doesn't change anything. You are spending time in the TL, reading something translated by a professional for the natives, and you also learn how to talk about your interests in the Target language.\n\nDon't limit yourself. The langauge is meant to widen your options, not limit them. If you mix originals with traductions, it's perfect. And even if you don't (for example I plan to focus mainly on translations, as I don't like German culture much), it's not a tragedy. You'll improve just fine and have a great time. \n\nAnd that's the key thing: in order to really improve, you need to read lots and lots.

I personally prioritize the original version of books above all, as that is the author's truest vision for their work, but I do enjoy reading translations in my TL, especially of Romance languages (ex: Jules Verne translated into Portuguese).

Justice should rightly be given to their work, if one is capable to read their works in the original language one should do so. Every work belonging to a language has some inherent cultural meaning that most makes sense in its native language, alliteration, rhyme, connotation of names, some part is lost in the act of translation. Reading a book originally written in English through a foreign language, as well as English fiction's popularization and influence more-so, is a more insidious way that Anglophone culture infiltrates and hegemonizes the literary scene of foreign languages.\n\nShort answer: You're missing out - on German Literature"", ""Anything that was originally written in an L2, I would prefer to read in that L2.  But I have been known to read in an L2 books that were translated from my L1 or from some other L, and I've gotten a kick more than once by seeing a Shakespeare play performed in one or another of my L2s.

Read whatever catches your interest; the more you read, the better you'll get."", 'You have to read texts that you like to make progress.

It's not inherently bad, but I would go in with the express goal of reading native material. \n\nWhen I started with unfamiliar native material with Spanish, I ended up learning a lot more and getting a better sense of the language and what was or wasn't artistic. Could have been a coincidence, sure. I'll never know what would have happened if I kept reading translated books. But I can't explain it, it's something about how it's written when it's not a translation. Plus, you might sometimes stumble on books where there are legitimately no translations. \n\nI don't know if you'll run into the same thing with German, but I found whole authors that generally didn't have English translations, or at least, I haven't found any translations of their books. It just so happens that if a book doesn't have international interest, it generally doesn't get transcribed, and then you have something where you legitimately need to know the language to have access to it. Don Quixote has been translated in a great many languages, you can read it without ever knowing Spanish, but pretty much anything by Miguel Otero Silva hasn't been translated as far as I know. So, you *could* be missing something if reading something like that interests you. Plus, there are probably culturally relevant books that might just be good to read if only to have a better sense of the culture. \n\nThat said, do what you do, we all do this for our own reasons.

It has been that way since forever. Shakespeare, Don Quijote, Alexandre Dumas, and many more have become part of the shared european or even global cultural associations and collective imagination. The same thing is happening today, just on a bigger scale.\n\nSo, stuff like Sherlock or Harry Potter is now part of German/French/Czech/many others culture too. Yes, it is hegemonization and we should surely spread other literatures too. But right now, I'd bet the current generations' collective cultural imagination is more formed by Harry Potter than by Goethe or Mann. It may be sad in some ways, but it is true. So, one might argue that in order to understand the contemporary cultural associations and imagination, popular translated works are a must."", ""I'll still try to give German authors a go because I realized I never read a single book written in German."", 'Haha well in that case, reading in your TL is still reading in your TL regardless!

It's like how ideally, German kids should culturally, learn to be familiar with French works, and French kids should naturally be familiar with German works, but instead what happens is that the common cultural touchstone they have is English works. There's bound to be non-English works that never gained their audience in their own language because English works are so dominant, and after that any new original book written in the native language that is influenced by it is seen by speakers of non-English language, the prestige of English makes the non-English works seem to be derivative or an imitation."", 'Reading your reply again, I think I get what you\'re saying: the dominance of the Anglophone ""Culture Industry"" in particular, the wide international market for adolescent fiction, which is read translated and in its original English all across the world from South America to Asia, is today the main cultural Actor in World Literature. Who cares which obscure author will win the Nobel Prize for Literature, it\'s what\'s top on Amazon right now that really counts!\n\nThanks for your insight.', 'And so the theory goes ... that every minor language will soon be a bastard of English; taking on not only its idioms, and its ways of saying, but also in literature its narrative structure and tropes as well.', ""Sure. I agree, but you won't change it by force or by making learners feel guilty for having fun with a translation. \n\nIf a learner, especially a younger learner, wants to learn a language and also socialize in it, they need to know the stuff their native equivalents read. A foreigner learning German won't change anything by avoiding anglophone works and instead reading only totally niche stuff. They'll just build a foundation to be weird and lonely later on, even if they reach C2 and meet natives.\n\nThe cure is more support for non-anglophone literatures everywhere, starting in our native languages. Buying originals and also buying translations from other languages than English. That's the only thing that would work, and it would require tons of marketing, to counter the English dominance.\n\nBut expecting a foreign language learner to change anything, that is simply ridiculous. All you can achieve is discouraging the learner from reading in general, setting them up for a too steep learning curve, and all that for nothing."", ':-D Aaaand this is the perfect example of not only a straw man (nope, nobody said YA was more than nobelists), but also of one of the factors contributing to people failing to get to an advanced level. \n\nMany teachers are just as snobbish as you, like ""Either you read high literature, or reading is not even worth it"". The result are tons of discouraged learners, who give up (partially because the high literature tends to be very difficult to start with, and also because they wouldn\'t really read it in any langauge).\n\nIt\'s all about your priorities. If you are learning a language for its high literature, it is a very noble pursuit indeed, and there is no replacement for the original classics.\n\nBut if you are primarily after the language, and perhaps want to socialize more, then the YA translation might serve you better.

In the past, the same thing was happening with French, German, Latin, and others.', ""I see that you're pragmatic, and I respect that. I just find the cultural exchange to be somewhat unbalanced. Say there's someone who speaks English and wants to learn German, so they find a pen-pal to talk about their favorite books, of course a fair exchange would be for them to talk in English about English books and in German about German books (or vice versa), however for pragmatic reasons they talk about the same (English) books in both languages. The unbalance makes it feel for both people as if one language, with its attendant culture is better, more superior. English speaking people wishing to learn a foreign language and their foreign-language teachers need to encourage reading foreign cultures because the foreign culture is an inseparable part of the foreign language and I stand by this. The concession of saying reading translated English works is totally fine is a kind of admittance that the foreign language might not be all that worthwhile to learn in the first place."", "">I'd bet the current generations' collective cultural imagination is more formed by Harry Potter than by Goethe or Mann.\n\nSorry for my bad faith interpretation, that's what I read in your reply.\n\nI was finding important, in the subtext or context of the question and this subreddit, that the popular culture industry of languages other than English, let's say German is totally not brought up at all, because English is so hegemonic. The German Language must have its own world of adolescent books, why can't learners get enough information and interest to find and read them?"", 'The theory goes that the changes were able to occur because that was all before international mass media and The Internet. After English has now become the language of the internet, it might never lose its place of dominance because of this infrastructure and body of educated speakers across the globe.', '1.Yes, it is very true that we live in a too English dominated world, but this is not the way to change it.\n\n2.in your example penpal situation, you assume that there is a huge amount of German books that both the learner and native want to read. This may simply not be true. Should they both force themselves to read something they don\'t want to, just to artificially fight for an illusion of equality on a minuscule scale?\n\n3.Another problem is the definition of ""foreing culture"". In the minds of most teachers (and I\'ve had some experience with like three dozen), culture=classics and other high literature. But many people don\'t really read classics, at least not everyday (as such books may require more energy, for example). They read also low genres, modern books, and so on. Narrowing the appropriate reading to originals, and only ""quality"" and ""high culture"", that\'s simply gonna discourage a learner, who would otherwise progress at the language just fine with a relaxing translated page turner.\n\n4.Your last point comes from a huge privilege. Don\'t forget that most learners worldwide are learning a language (most typically English) for purely pragmatic reasons, which are supposed to lead primarily to a better income.\n\nI don\'t like vast majority of German culture and am consuming mostly translated content. But even if I never touched an original book in it, getting out of a career impass will make it very worthwhile.\n\nThe most typical reason to learn German in my country is the hope to get a higher salary. Even four times higher for the same job, in the case of over the border workers (plus they get to do their shopping for less money and in higher quality while they are there, which further improves the financial advantage gained thanks to German). They couldn\'t care less about literature, and it is privileged and egoistic to look down upon them for it, no matter how sad it is in some ways.', 'In some languages, like French, there are tons of wonderful ""adolescent books"" or other light genres. In German, it is not so. In some genres, such as fantasy, scifi, YA, German is extremely poor considering its size. Both quantitatively and qualitatively. It is not the learners\' fault, that the Germans are underperforming in this area.\n\nIt is no wonder that a normal germanophone reader of such genres will be more familiar with the imported English books than those written in their own language. And a learner usually wants to get to know the normal native, so should read the same stuff, no?\n\nIn all my languages until German, reading the original authors has been one of the main sources of my motivation. In German: nope. Based on my experience so far (which is really not that small, I had read quite a lot of German books in translation before starting the language. Classics and low genres), I have very low expectations from German and prefer to focus on translations. The original books worth reading to me would simply not suffice even if I tried. After all, I am learning this language just for my career, not out of love. Just like many people.', ""It might not lose the place due to the infrasctructure (and a huge marketing network and a huge pressure on the job market even for jobs not really needing it), but we are already seeing several other languages really growing on the internet and elsewhere, such as Spanish. But as long as Spanish (or another language) doesn't get known by common people as the main language of earning money, it won't dethrone English.\n\nWhat we need the most is not letting the dominance spread too much, plurilingualism is the best norm right now. And I'd say reading translations is a better way for learners to learn other foreign languages, than not reading at all or getting discouraged reading stuff one doesn't like."", 'So it seems, reading your views, do you in fact find agreement with the prescription that I made for the language learners of today?

You are creating an impression and reproducing that marginalization in this very conversation. People reading get the impression (however accurate it might be) that Native German literature and culture is minor compared to English. An earnest search at a local library, or even on reddit itself would clearly lead you to relevant under appreciated works that German speaking youth do in fact read and share. I\'m of the opposite position from you, reducing learning a language to pragmatics, ultimately takes us to the ultimate pragmatic approach towards foreign languages, which is; ""why learn any foreign language other than English anyway?""', 'I think the main difference is that many ""mid range"" German authors are simply not well known abroad.\nMany countries that have literary giants tend to focus on those, essentially hiding the others.\nThe same can be said for Russian, Italian, Turkish...\nThere are, I am sure, interesting authors whose style might fit adult learners, but they\'re usually little known abroad, or even in the country itself.\n\nIf someone is learning Italian for example, I\'d recommend specific novels that might be interesting enough to an adult, but not so linguistically or culturally complicated as to be inscrutable.', "">In some genres, such as fantasy, scifi, **YA, German is extremely poor considering its size.** Both quantitatively and qualitatively. It is not the learners' fault, that the Germans are underperforming in this area.\n\nFirst, all of my responses will be heavily biased, as I love German :)\n\nSecond, while I see your point in general--that sometimes, a target language does not produce enough desired media for a given learner-- I would like to point out for anyone reading tjhat data still need to be interpreted--in this case, for the bolded part, I think that the question is: What does this mean, in real terms, for the non-native reader? \n\nIn other words, yes, in 2010, for example, Germany produced roughly [98 YA/children's books/million citizens](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1208381/childrens-young-adult-books-new-releases-number-germany/) vs. [191 YA/children's books/million in France.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/750390/production-children-and-youth-books-number-titles-france/) Seems like a lot fewer.\n\nBut one has to pull back and think: What are the raw numbers? In 2010, Germany published 8,082 children's/YA books! Regardless of Germany's population, 8,082 is essentially infinite for a non-native speaker. (And--and yes, I'm biased here--I happen to think that a fair number of the offerings *are* good qualitatively.) \n\nIn fact, [between 2003-2020, Germany published approximately 5-9k YA/childen's books/year](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1208381/childrens-young-adult-books-new-releases-number-germany/). Even a low-ball estimate becomes (5\\*18=) 90,000 books. \n\nIf a non-native reader cannot find enough decent material to read with 90,000 options in the desired genre, then that reader is too picky: even liking 1% yields 900 choices. Even saying 1/3 are available gives 300. Very few learners read over 300 books/year in general, much less in their target language."", ""Actually, yes. It might seem sad from some points of view, but it is true. And a pragmatic language learner recognizes that. Popular low genre literature, and Netflix are right now giving a better insight into contemporary shared imagination than Nobel Literature.\n\nAnd actually Amazon and Netlix have done a lot for spreading the stuff from non anglophone countries and even had a very good era of supporting more creative works from the non anglophone countries. They are always changing the strategies. But the viewers have some limited ways to affect the companies' interests. The most important change, that we are still waiting for and that will be a huge revolution for language learners, will be outlawing the geoblocking. This discrimination is one of the biggest obstacles in spreading works from non-anglophone countries."", 'It\'s not just about ""youth products"", please don\'t simplify the issue (let alone that many people use such terms to disrespect lower genres overall). Even in fantasy and scifi clearly for adults, German is really inferior to French or Polish. It is not the learners\' fault, if their learning is not oriented on making German literature better or more known, that is the natives\' task. \n\n**I find this hilarious, as you accuse me of further marginalizing German. I am native of a language, that German had nearly wiped out. And as such, I am clearly telling you, that the only ones deciding the marginalisation and the popularity of any language\'s literature are the natives.** Directly, by buying the books and reading them, but also through marketing and having their literature (high and low) translated and spread abroad. You can surely see the huge difference between Scandinavian countries spreading their thrillers, and Germany not spreading scifi. A Swedish learner interested in thrillers doesn\'t really need to read many translations. A German learner in love with scifi surely will.\n\nLet\'s not forget that a serious langauge learner needs to read A LOT. Ten thousand pages are my first goal around B2 usually. Nope, I didn\'t find 10000 pages of original German content that would interest me, especially the easier stuff to start with. \n\n""An earnest search at the local library"", and that is a part of the issue. It should not be expected from every learner, to invest a lot of extra effort just to find something not even the natives really commonly read.\n\n>I\'m of the opposite position from you, reducing learning a language to pragmatics, ultimately takes us to the ultimate pragmatic approach towards foreign languages, which is; ""why learn any foreign language other than English anyway?""\n\nNo, you are reducing and judging learners\' motivations. If they also aren\'t looking for original literature (especially high literature), and in love with the culture, you see us as inferior.\n\nThe person learning a language to understand its culture and history is just as valid as the person learning to speak with today\'s people and get a better salary. They have different goals and may have different paths and activities, but treating the second as inferior is in many cases unjust.\n\nAlso, we are using German a lot as the example here (because OP is learning German), and that is a bit specific too. Just like English globally, German is learnt mainly as school obligation or a path to a bigger salary in Europe. It is not a language commonly learnt out of love. Languages like French or Spanish often are. If we were starting the discussion from those, perhaps my view would be a bit more like yours, who knows.', 'Que pregunta más estupida incluso el idioma más hablado de todo el continente Americano es el Español.  por otro lado el Ingles solo es aprendido y encima mal por gente de idiomas nativos  irrelevantes con pocos habitantes ó con un idioma que únicamente  lo hablan en su país.', 'Nope, not true in this case. Even in the bookstores in Germany and German speaking parts of the Switzerland, their own authors of some genres are not in the most promoted selections, they are hard to find, the bookstores usually don\'t even have a ""German authors"" section in the lower genres, only in the high literature section. \n\nIt can be for a big part a marketing problem, and surely an international marketing problem (just look how well are the scandinavians doing with their thrillers), but definitely not only. Just in the last year year, I\'ve been to a dozen germanophone bookstores and always encountered the same problems.\n\nThere are simply too few ""mid range"" authors in some genres in the German speaking countries, and they are not seen by the booksellers as profitable enough, so a vicious circle is formed. And even the top germanophone authors in some genres are not always in stock and clearly visible on the shelves. \n\nIn a francophone bookstore, you will not find a divided secion like ""our fantasy"" and ""international"", but the French authors are always heavily represented on the shelves. And they clearly sell well. In a Czech bookstore, you will often find a whole bookcase of Czech fantasy/scifi, and then tons of international stuff (and nope, by far not only anglophone authors).\n\nIn a German bookstore, you will find a tiny minority of German authors in those genres, you won\'t always find even the few big names. I\'ve actually seen more German ""lower"" genre authors in French or Czech bookstores! That\'s how I became aware of them!', ""I find it a bit sad that people jump to the YA part of that short list and then to children's books (those two are different. Not every intermediate reading YA will also read books for smaller kids). I am not primarily after kids' books, the YA books are just a very good example of intermediate learning. But vast majority of fantasy and scifi are not kids' books.\n\nSo, how many of those 90000 options are actually just books for small kids=not really options? YA and kids' options are not the same thing. And how many of them are originals and how many are translations? I bet that in the YA part of the pile, vast majority will be translations\n\nWhere did you find those numbers? Would there be also numbers on different genres? I will look after work for numbers of published fantasy and scifi **for adults**. (not the same thing as YA or as fantasy/scifi for very young public)\n\n**Nope, the reader is not necessarily too picky, it's also the booksellers' evaluation of the books. The last several germanophone bookstores I was in didn't have those tons of books. The YA section had only translations from English and at most three originally German books. If the average booksellers don't have those books, they are probably not good enough even for the natives and really successful.**\n\nSo, why should the learner be holier than the pope?

And if a learner simply depends on what is being pushed as ""most successful,"" then I kind of agree with u/hippobiscuit\'s point: a lot of Germans criticize their books, often favoring Anglophones\', but this, I think, is a problem of literary hegemony/cultural imperialism that yes, **should** be resisted, because it\'s not as if Germany isn\'t a place that produces good writers!

The best app?,"Question for all of you language learners out there.

Currently I've been using Duolingo to learn German, but I've read that they might help you to a certain degree/level, it won't get you properly fluent, and for some words might not even help at all!

So far I've heard of:
- Duolingo 
- Babbel
- Mondly (not used yet)

Duolingo so far only got me so far with learning, only some basics and I've been using it for a good while too.
Babbel constantly spams me with Premium ads etc. and seems to be primarily for the written part of the language, while I'd rather learn the spoken part first.

I've heard of many other apps, but Reddit just doesn't have the answer to this yet, what apps do you all use, and how well do they work?",https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1dbuh3u/the_best_app/,0,27,"['The best app is the one that you\'ll consistently use.

German pronunciation and reading basics - any recommendations?,"I've reached a somewhat decent level in Spanish where I am now happy to continue building vocabulary and consuming media like books and movies.

I'd like to switch to actively learning German. Before actually using the typical courses like language transfer or Duolingo, I'd like to make sure I have learned all the sounds correctly especially since a few are definitely new to me.  

Would any of you know a decent course to walk me through the German alphabet and reading with specific focus on pronunciation/IPA/mouth shape etc to teach me the basics and give me a decent foundation ? 

That way when I start learning I can hear and practice the correct sounds instead of needing to correct them later.

You're not going to find any IPA resources that produce *exactly* the Standard-German vowel sounds.

I have forgotten a language in which I was amazing at…,"I feel so discouraged. I learned German the past 4 years passionately! I used to LOVE it.

For the past 2 year I haven’t praticed it at all. I haven’t read anything in German, haven’t watched anything, I haven’t praticed speaking it.

I want to improve my reading comprehension in German and French,"I enjoy reading, and I read a lot (novels, poetry and non-fiction) in Danish and English, and occasionally German and French too.

A long time ago I used a method where I would read an article or short story multiple times. On the first read-through, I'd underline every single word that I didn't know. Then I'd look up most if not all of those words and write the meanings in the margin, and read the text several times until I had learned the meaning of most of the words.

Readlang can help make it less annoying.\n\nI like paper books but I would prefer ebooks for the price and also the option to put them to Readlang. Unfortunately, I am not allowed to buy the foreign ones due to the EU still supporting geoblocking within the ""single market"" and the pirate sites don\'t fit my tastes sometimes. And a lot of the pirate sources has been destroyed, without any new legal options (such as allowing me to pay for the foreign books on foreign eshops).\n\nWhat helps with extensive reading: \n\n1.knowing the basics first. It is no problem to wait with reading till B2 or B1. People wanting to skip the coursebooks and just having fun usually fail to learn the language and just waste time, as far as I\'ve observed. \n\n2.choosing easier books at first. A Harry Potter translation is a good choice, especially for a fan knowing the books already. This and a few more things are always well translated, as the publishers couldn\'t have dared to mess up, unlike with many other books. Or books for older children and teens, those tend to be the easiest originals. After a few such books, it is much easier to progress to harder and harder ones.\n\n3.Extensive doesn\'t only mean reading a lot of content. I have found it much better to read only a few times per week but always for a longer time, than to read a few pages everyday. I know people recommend each other ""a little bit every day"" but I think it is absolute nonsense here.', ""Hey! I'm also studying German and French. :)  Something I did that helped a lot was to choose a book that had an English translation - I recently read Tchick/Why I Took the Car in German. I would read a chapter in German, and then read the same chapter in English. As I read in German, I didn't stop to look anything up unless it was really blocking my comprehension (like if, say, a word I didn't know kept showing up and was preventing me from getting the main idea of the text). But then once I finished the chapter in German, I'd read the same chapter in English to ensure that I had indeed gotten the right idea. As I went on, my comprehension and confidence improved, and sometimes I even read 2 or 3 chapters in German at once before going back to the English version. It's kind of a strange approach, sort of a hybrid between extensive reading and looking-things-up, but it worked well for me (it got me through my first non-English novel haha). And probably some time next year, I plan to go back and re-read the German version to see how far I've come in my comprehension. Good luck! :) <3"", 'I think you are doing pretty good especially with the German.  Think back to when you were a kid and trying to read books, esp your first books with Chapters!  I remember running to my mom every 5 mins with another ""what does this word mean"" or ""how do you pronounce this word."" She really wanted to foster a love of reading in me.\n\nThe problem, as I see it, it that you don\'t have that person in your life to run to with the same questions when you are reading a book in a non-native language who will have the same patience and understanding as your parents and teachers did when you were in Elementary School.  \n\nCongrats on what you can do! You are beyond me in both languages, even though I have been trying to figure out German for over half my life.  Cheers!', ""Just wanted to drop a quick suggestion.  I have developed a Lang-8 like site called [Finite Languages](https://www.finitelanguages.com) that's designed for intermediate and up level language learners in German, French, Italian and English.  People write in their target language and get corrections for free just like Lang-8.  HOWEVER, you also receive an analytic report that shows how your writing style compares to a database of native-written texts.  These scores and corrections are all tracked on your profile.\n\nHere's why this is valid.  Users can choose to post any texts they write publicly or privately.  Any public post exists for readers like you to read in a bilingual format so you can try to really understand the text.  Check it out, I would love to hear any feedback you have.  It's been my baby for the past 8 months :)\n\n[www.finitelanguages.com](https://www.finitelanguages.com)""]"
"I'm starting a video series to help intermediate and advanced German learners with reading real books - basically a ""guided tour"" through German novels, starting with Der Richter und Sein Henker",,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X40Gmzz05oM,23,12,"['I have no knowledge of German but you have a lovely cadence to your voice when you speak German, and to a non German speaker it sounds very authentic. How did you learn?', ""It's great and super useful, I love it! I don't even know how many times I'll need to watch it through. One small suggestion: it would be quite easier to follow if sentences were separated with blank lines, or perhaps even each clause on a separate line and then one empty line between sentences, and maybe \\*\\*\\* between paragraphs. Generally having more white space around would give more room for marking up."", ""Good timing!\n\nI've recently tried reading Konfuzius, then Nietzche Der Antichrist, then Gargantua in translation, and now finally reading Der Name Der Rose by Eco in translation. I've had trouble with first 2 of these because they are too abstract, with Gargantua because the language and sentences are very flowery and medieval-style; but really love Der Name Der Rose so far and find it quite easy to follow, for the most part, even though it also has a mock-medieval style (but keeps it within reason)."", ""Thank you for this. It seems very useful even though I'm not a native English speaker."", 'Great video, thanks for posting! Also great pronunciation and especially intonation!  \n\nOne tiny comment from a native speaker, if I may: I\'d pronounce Spätherbst with an audible ""h"", like in ""hin und her"". Yours sounded a bit like giving an impression of a French German accent: Spät\'erbst', 'I totally want to steal this idea for Spanish now haha.', 'Thank you, I appreciate the compliment! I worked very hard on my accent. At the beginning, I would sing songs in German (only to myself, I\'m not a good singer...). That let me focus on exact sounds very carefully and because it was to a musical rhythm, it made it all the more obvious when I wasn\'t making a sound quite right. Then to get the natural cadence I spent tons of time specifically on imitating (kind of ""parroting"") native Germans as I learned grammar and vocab.', ""Thanks for the feedback! This is the first time I've done something like this so, knowing there'd be lots of room for improvement, I've been on the lookout for ways I can make this format better as I go (besides the obvious things like making sure not to drift out of frame...)\n\nI tried to make the print large but in practice I think it could definitely stand to be way bigger with way more whitespace. I was trying to limit the number of pages I had to use but that doesn't really matter as much as the clarity of each sentence/clause. One thought I also had was to try drawing | vertical lines | to separate sentences or clauses as I'm explaining them. I think I'll try doing both in my next video."", 'Ah, yes! I did not even realize I did that, thank you!\n\nAs confident as I am in my accent, I definitely have these random blind spots where I only notice I\'m saying something weird when someone points it out to me, then I\'m like ""Ohh... that should\'ve been obvious...""', ""Just a super quick question, is it possible you could provide a link to the story perhaps as a guide-along sort of thing. I'd rather have the sheets infront of me while listening to you and marking up my paper as well. Would be mega cool!\n\nIf that isn't possible I love it as it is!

App for reading that offers the possibility to build a list of unknown words,"Hi,

I'm reading ebook in a foreign language. Obviously, I'm finding a lot of words I don't know through the reading. Do you know of any app for Android  that offers an easy and quick way to make a list of all these unknown words, in order to learn them and test myself at the and of the chapter or the book? 

For exemple, I can keep note of the words by highlighting them, so it will be nice if I could export all the higlighted notes in a file.",https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/loubkv/app_for_reading_that_offers_the_possibility_to/,3,4,"['Not technically an app, but I use ReadLang for this and it works well.', ""I've used Beelinguapp, let's you save words on its own list, not sure if it has an export feature or not, been a while since I used it"", 'you can import books to ling q.
